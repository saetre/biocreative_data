In human cells, APE1 excises sugar fragments that block the 3&#x02032;-ends thus facilitating DNA repair synthesis. In <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, the causal agent of leishmaniasis, the APE1 homolog is the class II AP endonuclease LMAP. Expression of LMAP but not of APE1 reverts the hypersensitivity of a <italic>xth nfo</italic> repair-deficient <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain to the oxidative compound hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). To identify the residues specifically involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage, we generated random mutations in the <italic>ape1</italic> gene and selected those variants that conferred protection against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Among the resistant clones, we isolated a mutant in the nuclease domain of APE1 (D70A) with an increased capacity to remove 3&#x02032;-blocking ends <italic>in vitro</italic>. D70 of APE1 aligns with A138 of LMAP and mutation of the latter to aspartate significantly reduces its 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activity. Kinetic analysis shows a novel role of residue D70 in the excision rate of 3&#x02032;-blocking ends. The functional and structural differences between the parasite and human enzymes probably reflect a divergent molecular evolution of their DNA repair responses to oxidative damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Oxidative DNA damage is induced by ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), by reactive oxygen species produced by the aerobic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and by the action of some antitumoral agents such as neocarzinostatin and bleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The attack of DNA by free radicals gives rise to oxidative base damage, abasic sites and single-strand breaks containing modified 3&#x02032;-ends, such as 3&#x02032;-phosphoglycolate (3&#x02032;-PG) and 3&#x02032;-phosphate (3&#x02032;-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>). Damaged 3&#x02032;-ends may also arise as intermediates during base excision repair (BER), resulting from the cleavage of the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site by bifunctional DNA glycosylases. For instance, human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and the endonuclease III (NTH) have intrinsic associated &#x003b2;-lyase activity that cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 3&#x02032; to the abasic site through a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction to produce a 3&#x02032;-&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;-unsaturated aldehyde (3&#x02032;-dRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). In contrast, endonuclease VIII-like (NEIL) glycosylases incise the abasic site by &#x003b2;,&#x003b4;-elimination generating a 3&#x02032;-P terminus at the DNA strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). These 3&#x02032;-blocking damages must be removed prior to DNA repair synthesis. The current model for excision of 3&#x02032;-damaged ends is initiated by a 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase or 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity that cleaves the phosphodiester bond at 5&#x02032; position of the 3&#x02032;-blocking group. The product is a single nucleotide gap with 3&#x02032;-hydroxyl (3&#x02032;-OH) and 5&#x02032;-phosphate termini. The repair is then accomplished by the incorporation of one nucleotide by a DNA polymerase (DNA repair synthesis) and the covalent sealing of the strand break by a DNA ligase (DNA sealing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Cells have different ways to handle 3&#x02032;-blocking ends. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> possesses two class II abasic (AP) endonucleases capable of repairing such strand breaks by excision of the 3&#x02032;-blocking groups: exonuclease III and endonuclease IV, encoded by <italic>xthA</italic> and <italic>nfo</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>). <italic>xthA</italic> and <italic>xthA nfo</italic> strains are highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), oxidative agent that induces strand breaks with 3&#x02032;-blocking damages as primary lethal lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In human cells, the exonuclease III homolog is AP endonuclease 1, APE1. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the human enzyme can catalyze the hydrolysis of 3&#x02032;-PG residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22">18&#x02013;22</xref>) and also the removal of the 3&#x02032;-dRP generated after &#x003b2;-elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>) although its 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase function has been reported less efficient than its incision activity on AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In fact, the expression of human AP endonuclease can replace bacterial exonuclease III at repairing alkylation-induced AP sites, but not at processing the strand breaks generated by oxidative agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In spite of this, APE1 has been shown to provide the major phosphoglycolate removal activity in human cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) although other sources of such activity cannot be ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32 B33">29&#x02013;33</xref>). APE1 also has DNA 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) has been reported as the primary 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity responsible for the excision of 3&#x02032;-P lesions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). In addition, APE1 has 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), which could be physiologically relevant in the removal of mismatched or damaged nucleotides incorporated during the synthesis step of BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Finally, APE1 can also incise DNA at the 5&#x02032;-position of oxidized pyrimidine bases such as 5,6-dihydro-thymine or 5,6-dihydro-2&#x02032;-deoxyuracil (DHU), thus initiating a repair process known as nucleotide incision repair (NIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).</p><p>Human cells possess a second AP endonuclease of the exonuclease III family, APE2, which is endowed with strong 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease and 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activities but a very low AP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The presence of these biochemical activities in the purified protein suggests an important role in the processing of 3&#x02032;-blocking ends and in the proofreading of 3&#x02032;-mismatched nucleotides.</p><p>Kinetoplastid parasites such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> are exposed to a highly oxidative environment within the host macrophage. Our previous studies suggest that <italic>L. major</italic>'s AP endonuclease LMAP must play an important role in parasite survival mediating the repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and 3&#x02032;-blocked termini induced by oxidative stress since in addition to its function as an AP endonuclease, LMAP has an equally efficient 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase and a significant 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In contrast to human APE1, over-expression of LMAP in <italic>E. coli</italic> protects against both methyl methanesulphonate (MMS) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> indicating that LMAP efficiently repairs the DNA lesions caused by these two DNA damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Therefore, we were interested in identifying the specific residues involved in the recognition and/or cleavage of 3&#x02032;-blocking ends at single strand breaks by these two AP endonucleases. Since LMAP has no obvious structural particularities that may account for such different enzymatic behavior, we sought to isolate mutants with altered repair capacity of this type of lesions. In the present study, we report the isolation of a mutant in the nuclease domain of APE1 that protects <italic>xth nfo E. coli</italic> strain against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damage and has an increased 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase and 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activities. The mutation consists in a single base change, leading to the single amino acid change D70A. The opposed mutation at the corresponding position in LMAP (A138D) was then introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and the complementation phenotypes and enzymatic properties of these mutants were determined. The study reveals a novel role for D70 of APE1 in the repair of damaged 3&#x02032;-ends and discusses its possible implication in the process of catalysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>The construction of expression vectors pKK-ape1 and pKK-LMAP has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).

Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5&#x02032;-end using [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides were purified using MicroSpin G25 columns (GE Healthcare) and annealed to 1.5-fold molar excess of the complementary strand by incubating at 95&#x000b0;C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature.

After exposure to the genotoxic agent, cells were centrifuged, washed and resuspended in the same volume of PBS buffer. Cells were then inoculated into 96-well flat bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark) at a density of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/100 &#x000b5;l. Wells without cells served as control. Twenty microlitres of Resazurin (1.1 mg/ml, Sigma) were added to each well and incubated in the dark for 1 h at 28&#x000b0;C. After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 &#x000b5;l of 3% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS).

This residue appears to be restricted to mammalian enzymes since other eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences have alanine or asparagine at the same position. An exception is human APE2 that, together with yeast APN2, presents an asparagine instead of an aspartate. Interestingly, in the AP endonuclease LMAP from <italic>L. major</italic>, D70 is substituted by an alanine at residue 138.

The expression of the LMAP wild-type protein in the selected clone was associated with at least a 5- and 8-fold increase in the 3&#x02032;-PG excision and AP site-cleavage activity levels, respectively. In contrast, the over-expression of LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> in cell line pX-138 reduced the level of 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase around 5-fold respect to the endogenous activity of cell line pX (according to the product formed at 100 ng of protein extract) while surprisingly, the level of AP site incision remained similar. It should be taken into consideration that repair activities of recombinant proteins may not necessarily reflect effective cellular repair since factors that modulate incision activities may be absent in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay.</p><p>In an earlier study it was demonstrated that parasites overproducing LMAP have an enhanced resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Here, we compared the viability of cell lines overproducing either wild-type LMAP or LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> in the presence of the DNA damaging agents H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methyl methanesulphonate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E (left) shows the effect on cell survival after 1-h exposure to increasing concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Following treatment with 0.5 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the number of viable cells expressing LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> is reduced to 50% while the proportion of surviving cells transfected with the empty vector or over-expressing LMAP remains 76% and 86%, respectively. Indeed, exposure to 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has a minor effect on the survival of cell-line pX-LMAP (80%) but produces a considerable impact on cell line pX (50%) and even more pronounced on cell line pX-138 (30%). Therefore, while parasites expressing LMAP were protected against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, cells over-expressing LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> became even more sensitive to killing by this oxidative agent than cells transfected with the empty vector. It can be concluded that residue A138 plays an important role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage by LMAP and its substitution by an aspartate has an impact on the viability of cells exposed to oxidative agents. In contrast, the expression of the LMAP or LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> proteins did not have a significant effect on survival after treatment with MMS, which alkylates mainly purine bases in DNA and produces AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>E, right). Similar results have been obtained expressing the <italic>Ape1</italic> cDNA in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>), suggesting that the constitutive levels of AP-endonuclease activity in both organisms are sufficient to repair the AP sites generated by alkylating agents. Thus, the lethal effect observed after MMS treatment is probably due to the block of DNA replication by the alkylation-induced DNA adducts such as N<sup>3</sup>-methyl adenine.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Human APE1 protein has been subjected to an exhaustive search for residues that are critical for cleavage of DNA at AP sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52 B53 B54 B55 B56 B57 B58 B59 B60 B61">52&#x02013;61</xref>). Active site residues involved in hydrolysis and metal coordination or AP site binding have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis on highly conserved amino acids and by the analysis of the crystal structure of APE1 bound to substrate abasic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). Besides its AP endonuclease activity, APE1 can remove some types of 3&#x02032;-blocking lesions at DNA single-strand breaks <italic>in vitro</italic>, on account of its 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase, 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exonuclease and 3&#x02032;-phosphatase activities. However, even if the different nuclease activities of the APE1 protein appear to share a common active site, the human enzyme carries out these other types of chemical reactions at a lower rate than AP site cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>). It results obvious that some unnoticed structural elements of the enzyme must modulate substrate specificity, although to date, the catalytical determinants for the hydrolysis of 3&#x02032;-end damaged termini have not been fully understood. More intriguingly, other AP endonucleases belonging to the same family, such as exonuclease III and the AP endonuclease from <italic>L. major</italic> LMAP, share with APE1 the overall 3D structure and most of the catalytic groups in their active sites and can catalyze the removal of damaged nucleotides and phosphate groups from 3&#x02032;-ends more efficiently than APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). All the biochemical reactions mentioned, including AP site cleavage, entail the hydrolysis of a P&#x02013;O bond but the substrates differ in size, charge and/or structure. It is therefore of interest to understand how similar catalytic sites can account for different substrate specificities.</p><p>As shown by protein engineering and <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution experiments, single amino acid substitutions can drastically change substrate specificity and increase the activity of any enzyme. In this regard, there are several examples of how mutations can alter the activity and reaction specificity of DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). We have taken advantage from such functional plasticity and using a complementation assay in a repair-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, have selected a mutant in the nuclease domain of the human AP Endonuclease 1 (APE1<sup>D70A</sup>) that confers resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damage. D70 is a poorly conserved residue located in the middle of a highly conserved region comprising amino acids 62&#x02013;78 of the human protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). <italic>In vitro</italic>, the purified APE1<sup>D70A</sup> protein shows a higher capacity to process different types of 3&#x02032;-blocking ends including 3&#x02032;-PG, 3&#x02032;-dRP and 3&#x02032;-P groups. It also has an enhanced exonuclease activity on mismatched 3&#x02032;-nucleotides within single-strand breaks. A comparative analysis with APE2 has allowed for the identification of F266 and W280 as two residues critical for 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; DNA exonuclease activity and APE1 mutants with increased exonuclease activity have been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>). However, these residues do not appear to be responsible for the increased phosphodiesterase and exonuclease activities of <italic>Leishmania</italic> AP endonuclease which exhibits the same residues as APE1.</p><p>Our results suggest that aspartate 70 modulates the substrate specificity of the enzyme. In agreement, the change of alanine by an aspartate at the equivalent position in LMAP clearly decreases the excision of 3&#x02032;-blocking ends by the parasitic enzyme. A kinetic analysis shows that the replacement of aspartate by an alanine in APE1 enhances the rate of cleavage of 3&#x02032;-PG termini without affecting the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, which indicates that catalysis or a step following catalysis is accelerated by the amino acid change. In other words, the aspartate residue limits somehow the catalytic turnover of APE1 and LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> for 3&#x02032;-damage excision. It is worth noting that this negative effect is probably due to the charge and not the size of the aspartate side chain since the catalytically efficient exonuclease III and human APE2 have asparagine at the same position. On the contrary, D138 in LMAP and D70 in APE1 must play different roles during the AP site incision reaction since both D70A and A138D mutations reduce the rate of AP site cleavage. It is probable that the parasitic enzyme possesses adaptive second site features that substitute the function carried out by D70 in human APE1 and confer the maximal AP endonuclease activity.</p><p>Several structural and biochemical studies have suggested that amino acid D70 contributes to the coordination of the cationic metal at the active site of APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). However, the aspartate is substituted by asparagine or alanine in other AP endonucleases (i.e. exoIII and LMAP) and its replacement by mutagenesis does not have a dramatic effect on the incision activity of APE1 (43; this study). When the specific activities of wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined over a range of metal concentrations, the activity versus magnesium concentration curves showed two different effects of the metal ion as previously described. Low magnesium concentrations stimulate catalysis, as this ion is required for the cleavage reaction, while high metal concentrations result inhibitory for the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Furthermore, lower magnesium concentrations were required for inhibition of wild-type APE1 than for the mutant D70A. The opposite effect was observed with LMAP and mutant A138D indicating that metal ion-mediated inhibition is more pronounced on those enzymes with aspartate. The inhibition of APE1 activity by high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations has been hypothesized to be due to an oversaturation of the enzyme catalytic site when the two proposed existent metal sites are occupied simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>). In this scenario, it can be hypothesized that at high metal concentrations, aspartate 70 attracts Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to the active site that interfere with the catalytic process. A close examination of the APE1-DNA crystal structure suggests an alternate possibility. The situation of D70 makes possible an interaction with the DNA strand complementary to the AP site DNA. Such interaction might distort the DNA and contribute to the positioning of the substrate in the active site. At inhibiting metal concentrations, the &#x02018;extra&#x02019; metal ions recruited by D70 would perturb the interaction and hence, the substrate alignment at the catalytic site. The partial loss of AP incision activity of the D70A mutant might be due at least in part, to a poor substrate orientation in the active site when the aspartate is absent. It is tempting to speculate that the interaction between D70 and the DNA strand opposite to the AP site (when D70 is not bound to Mg<sup>2+</sup>) favors cleavage of AP sites by exerting an influence on the DNA conformation as described above, but somehow impedes the correct positioning of the more &#x02018;bendable&#x02019; bonds that bear phosphoglycolates, phosphates or mismatched nucleotides. We are aware that the available data are not sufficient to understand the role of residue D70 during AP site or 3&#x02032;-end cleavage and further structural and biochemical experimentation will be required to fully establish its function.</p><p>Regardless of the possible catalytic mechanism, our work reveals significant differences in the processing of 3&#x02032;-blocking DNA damages between kinetoplastid parasites and humans. The presence of alanine or aspartate in the AP endonucleases from these two organisms provides an exceptional perspective on the molecular evolution of their DNA repair responses to oxidative damage. It is reasonable to think that genetic changes took place probably according to the amount and different types of DNA damage they were exposed to. In <italic>Leishmania</italic> cells, the efficient functioning of its oxidative damaged DNA repair pathways is likely critical for survival during the oxidative burst that takes place in the mammalian host. In support of this, we have shown that over-expression of LMAP protects the parasite against high levels of oxidative stress induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Although DNA single-strand breaks are probably the primary lethal lesion induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, AP site and exonuclease repair activities of APE1 can possibly contribute to this protection. In contrast, expression of mutant LMAP<sup>A138D</sup> protein sensitizes the cells treated with this oxidative agent. An excess of mutant enzyme in the cell may block access to the 3&#x02032;-damaged strand breaks of the endogenous LMAP thus slowing down repair and increasing cell death. Taken together, our results provide novel structural and functional information that might be exploited in the rational design of selective inhibitors to treat leishmaniasis.</p><p>DNA single-strand breaks are also frequent lesions in human DNA and their repair of vital importance for the cell. <italic>In vivo</italic>, the catalytical deficit of APE1 as 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase might be compensated by the action of other factors that activate or complement APE1 function. For instance, the XRCC1 protein, absent in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, has been shown to act as a scaffold and modulator of different BER activities. XRCC1 physically interacts with APE1 and stimulates, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>, its AP endonuclease and 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>). In addition, recent studies show that human cells possess other enzymes with strong 3&#x02032;-phosphodiesterase activities <italic>in vitro</italic> like APE2, a second class II AP endonuclease, and aprataxin, the gene product defective in the neurological disorder AOA1 (ataxia oculomotor apraxia-1). These enzymes might assist APE1 in the repair of 3&#x02032;-PG lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Thus, human cells have evolved to possess a variety of DNA repair factors capable to initiate the processing of DNA single-strand breaks and maintain genome integrity. Why one of these major factors, APE1, has not been fully optimized during evolution in terms of reaction rate is an important question that should be answered in order to understand its function.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Plan Nacional de Investigaci&#x000f3;n (SAF2005-02287); Programa de Ayudas de Retorno de Doctores (Junta de Andaluc&#x000ed;a to A.E.V.); Programa Ram&#x000f3;n y Cajal (Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia to A.E.V.).
