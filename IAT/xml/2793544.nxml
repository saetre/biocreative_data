Agrin-stimulation of MuSK is known to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade that leads to the clustering of AChRs in an actin polymerization-dependent manner, but the molecular steps which link MuSK activation to AChR aggregation remain incompletely defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study we used biochemical, cell biological and molecular assays to investigate a possible role in AChR clustering of cortactin, a protein which is a tyrosine kinase substrate and a regulator of F-actin assembly and which has also been previously localized at AChR clustering sites. We report that cortactin was co-enriched at AChR clusters in situ with its target the Arp2/3 complex, which is a key stimulator of actin polymerization in cells. Cortactin was further preferentially tyrosine phosphorylated at AChR clustering sites and treatment of myotubes with agrin significantly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Importantly, forced expression in myotubes of a tyrosine phosphorylation-defective cortactin mutant (but not wild-type cortactin) suppressed agrin-dependent AChR clustering, as did the reduction of endogenous cortactin levels using RNA interference, and introduction of the mutant cortactin into muscle cells potently inhibited synaptic AChR aggregation in response to innervation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest a novel function of phosphorylation-dependent cortactin signaling downstream from agrin/MuSK in facilitating AChR clustering at the developing NMJ.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>At the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) motor nerve-secreted acetylcholine (ACh) binds and opens postsynaptic ACh receptors (AChRs) to initiate excitation along the muscle membrane and cause contraction.

Is cortactin's phosphorylation in muscle affected by agrin/MuSK signaling? Does cortactin signaling in any way regulate synaptic AChR aggregation? The results of our cell biological, biochemical and molecular assays presented below suggest that phosphorylation-dependent signaling by cortactin downstream from agrin/MuSK promotes AChR clustering at the NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Localization of Actin-Polymerization Regulators at AChR Clustering Sites</title><p>We previously showed that dynamic F-actin assembly occurs at sites of de novo AChR clustering and that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged cortactin is recruited to such sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Dai1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Madhavan2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Unlike these three antibodies, however, many control antibodies showed markedly different labeling of muscle cells. For example, a polyclonal antibody against tyrosine-phosphorylated AChR &#x003b2;-subunit labeled only AChR clusters, two different polyclonal antibodies against cadherin complex proteins strongly stained cell junctions but not AChR clusters, and other polyclonal antibodies either labeled muscle cells uniformly (such as an anti-phospho-Shp2 phosphatase antibody) or failed to label the cells (such as anti-synapsin) (R.M., A.W.S.C., H.B.P., unpublished observations).</p><p>Next we examined whether cortactin is phosphorylated at sites of new AChR cluster formation.

Phospho-cortactin's localization closely matched that of postsynaptic AChR clusters, but labeling for phospho-cortactin was weak in presynaptic neurites (which were strongly labeled, as expected, by antibodies against neuronal markers such as synapsin; not shown).

Thus src-cortactin signaling may be spatially restricted to the synaptic regions of muscle where intimate coupling of MuSK and src activation could lead to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin; this, in turn, could locally enhance Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization to generate &#x0201c;traps&#x0201d; that capture mobile AChRs.</p><p>Currently a role of cortactin at the NMJ in vivo cannot be directly tested because suitable models &#x02013; viable animals with global or muscle-specific cortactin gene deletion &#x02013; are unavailable. Moreover, through our own work we noted that Xenopus embryos which had been injected with the phospho-mutant cortactin mRNA failed to grow to a stage at which NMJs in the developing tail could be studied. We were, however, successful in using this dominant-negative approach to show that interference with phosphorylation-dependent cortactin signaling in muscle is sufficient for inhibiting nerve-induced AChR clustering, and by extension NMJ formation, in culture. Interestingly, others have studied mice lacking src kinase activity in muscle and have shown that while NMJs can develop in the muscles of these mice, the synaptic AChR aggregates found are less stable than their counterparts in the muscles of normal mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Smith1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. One explanation for this observation is that src binds to AChRs and phosphorylates them, which enhances the cytoskeletal linkage of AChRs through rapsyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Borges1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Moransard1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Friese1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Borges2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The results of this study raise the additional possibility that in the absence of normal src activity, sub-optimal signaling by cortactin leads to the assembly of synaptic scaffolds which hold AChRs poorly at NMJs.</p><p>Properly balanced src signaling is important for normal AChR clustering at the NMJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Camilleri1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, but what all targets of src influence AChR clustering at the NMJ is incompletely understood. By uncovering a role of the src-substrate cortactin in AChR clustering this study suggests a previously unappreciated way by which src could regulate AChR aggregation at the NMJ. Interestingly, two other src-substrates we previously identified as targets in agrin/MuSK signaling produced effects distinct from those described here for cortactin: p120ctn promoted myopodial induction in response to agrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Madhavan3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas signal-regulatory protein &#x003b1;1 (SIRP&#x003b1;1) stimulated the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 to limit MuSK-dependent AChR clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Zhao1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and to also facilitate the dispersal of pre-patterned AChR clusters by synaptogenic stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Qian1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, cortactin can participate in p120ctn signaling in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Boguslavsky1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref> and can act together with the p120ctn-relative &#x003b4;-catenin in generating filopodia-like dendritic protrusions in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-AbuElneel1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, cortactin itself also affects dendritic spine morphogenesis and remodeling, with the depletion of cortactin in neurons causing a reduction in spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Hering1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Jaworski1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, cortactin-dependent actin polymerization triggered by src could potentially facilitate p120ctn-mediated myopodial assembly at the NMJ as well as synapse formation in central neurons. And, although it is not known which phosphatases dephosphorylate cortactin in muscle cells, the spread of phosphatase activity initiated by agrin/MuSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Madhavan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Qian1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Madhavan4">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> may bring about the dephosphorylation of extrasynaptic cortactin to maintain efficient actin polymerization by src-cortactin signaling selectively at developing NMJs where agrin stimulates MuSK. Future studies investigating the spatiotemporal control of cortactin's phosphorylation levels during neuronal synapse development and testing whether that phosphorylation affects cortactin's ability to influence the formation of structures such as dendritic spines should yield further insights into cortactin's functions at CNS synapses and elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>Agrin was obtained from the conditioned medium of HEK293 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding neural agrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008478-Daggett1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.
