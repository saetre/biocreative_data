The hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway, which includes the transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), plays vital roles in gastrointestinal tract development, homeostasis, and malignancy. We identified a germline variation in <italic>GLI1</italic> (within the IBD2 linkage region, 12q13) in patients with IBD. Since this IBD-associated variant encodes a GLI1 protein with reduced function and our expression studies demonstrated down-regulation of the HH response in IBD, we tested whether mice with reduced Gli1 activity demonstrate increased susceptibility to chemically induced colitis.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Using a gene-wide haplotype-tagging approach, germline <italic>GLI1</italic> variation was examined in three independent populations of IBD patients and healthy controls from Northern Europe (Scotland, England, and Sweden) totalling over 5,000 individuals. On log-likelihood analysis, <italic>GLI1</italic> was associated with IBD, predominantly UC, in Scotland and England (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs2228226C&#x02192;G), in exon 12 of <italic>GLI1</italic> (Q1100E) was strongly implicated, with pooled odds ratio of 1.194 (confidence interval &#x0003d; 1.09&#x02013;1.31, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0002). <italic>GLI1</italic> variants were tested in vitro for transcriptional activity in luciferase assays. Q1100E falls within a conserved motif near the C terminus of GLI1; the variant GLI protein exhibited reduced transactivation function in vitro. In complementary expression studies, we noted the colonic HH response, including GLI1, patched (PTCH), and hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP), to be down-regulated in patients with UC. Finally, <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> mice were tested for susceptibility to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis. Clinical response, histology, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were recorded. <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> mice rapidly developed severe intestinal inflammation, with considerable morbidity and mortality compared with wild type. Local myeloid cells were shown to be direct targets of HH signals and cytokine expression studies revealed robust up-regulation of IL-12, IL-17, and IL-23 in this model.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>HH signalling through GLI1 is required for appropriate modulation of the intestinal response to acute inflammatory challenge.

The immune system normally protects the body from entities it identifies as foreign, but in IBD it mistakenly recognizes gut tissue, and immune system cells accumulate in the lining of the bowel, which causes inflammation. There are two main types of IBD&#x02014;Crohn's disease (CD), which mainly affects the small bowel, and ulcerative colitis (UC), which affects only the large bowel (colon). Both types tend to run in families and usually develop between the ages of 15 and 35 years. Symptoms&#x02014;including diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and unexplained weight loss&#x02014;can be mild or severe and the disease can develop slowly or suddenly. There is no cure for IBD except surgical removal of the affected part of the digestive tract. However, drugs that modulate the immune system (for example, corticosteroids) or that specifically inhibit &#x0201c;proinflammatory cytokines&#x0201d; (proteins made by the immune system that stimulate inflammation) are often helpful in reducing symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Why the immune system becomes unbalanced in people with IBD is not clear but it is known that IBD is &#x0201c;polygenic,&#x0201d; that is, a disease caused by the combined actions of two or more inherited gene variants. Although UC and CD are clinically different diseases, they share several &#x0201c;susceptibility loci&#x0201d; (regions of the genome that harbor disease-associated gene variants), including the IBD2 locus. The identification of the actual gene within the IBD2 locus that is altered in people who are susceptible to IBD might provide new insights into what causes the immune imbalance in IBD and into how to treat the disease. In this study, the researchers test the hypothesis that a variant of a gene called <italic>GLI1</italic>, which lies in the IBD2 locus, is associated with IBD susceptibility. <italic>GLI1</italic> encodes a transcription factor (a protein that regulates the production of proteins) that is a central component in the signaling pathway named for a protein called &#x0201c;hedgehog.&#x0201d; This pathway is involved in the development of many organs, including the digestive tract.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used a technique called gene-wide haplotype tagging to look for inherited <italic>GLl1</italic> variants in patients with IBD and in healthy people living in Scotland, England, and Sweden. A specific variant of the <italic>GLI1</italic> gene, resulting in alteration of a single amino acid component of the GLI1 protein, was associated with IBD (particularly with UC) in both Scotland and England; the same variant was weakly associated with IBD in the Swedish population. The variant GLI1 protein was only half as active as the normal protein in a laboratory assay, and, consistent with this result, the expression of several components of the hedgehog signaling pathway was lower in colon samples taken from patients with UC than in samples taken from healthy individuals. Finally, <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> mice (which express half the normal amount of Gli1 protein) developed severe intestinal inflammation more rapidly than wild-type mice when they were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), a chemical that induces acute (sudden) colitis. Cellular analysis revealed that myeloid cells (cells that sense and modify the inflammatory response) are direct targets of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Furthermore, the expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (in particular, one called IL-23) increased more markedly in the <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> mice than in the wild-type mice after DSS treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that the normal response of the mammalian gut to challenge with inflammatory substances involves hedgehog signaling through GLI1 and that reduced GLI1 function might be one trigger for IBD. More specifically, the human genetic studies identify a <italic>GLI1</italic> variant that is associated with IBD (at least in certain north European populations), the laboratory experiments indicate that this <italic>GLI1</italic> variant encodes a protein with reduced activity, and the animal studies show that a similar reduction in Gli1 activity is sufficient to heighten intestinal inflammatory responses. Although this last result needs to be confirmed in animal models of chronic colitis that more closely resemble human IBD, these findings suggest that drugs that modulate hedgehog signaling might be useful in the treatment of IBD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050239">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050239</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000249.htm">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000250.htm">ulcerative colitis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to other information <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/crohnsdisease.html">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ulcerativecolitis.html">ulcerative colitis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis">ulcerative colitis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Direct Encyclopedia also provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=115">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=381">ulcerative colitis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has a page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_pathway">the hedgehog signaling pathway</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lees CW, Zacharias WJ, Tremelling M, Noble CL, Nimmo ER, et al.

However, along with other commentators, we would urge caution in the use of the commercially available HH pathway antibodies presently available &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. We note further that the expression analysis of disease samples in humans is inherently limited in that it only depicts a complex process at a late time point in established disease. Nonetheless, in combination with studies utilizing models (such as the <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> mouse) to directly correlate HH response with inflammatory challenge, these studies provide useful information to help elucidate the aetiology of human inflammatory disease.</p><p><italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> animals, which have only 50&#x00025; of the WT level of Gli1, develop severe and rapid inflammation in response to DSS, despite having normal histological structure and a largely WT cytokine and chemokine profile prior to DSS treatment. These data, to our knowledge, provide the first description of a phenotype for reduced Gli1 function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, and demonstrate the key role that a full complement of Gli1 plays in protection from inflammatory disease. Our in vitro data demonstrate that GLI1 E1100 is capable of activating some GLI1 response, suggesting that under homeostatic conditions, GLI1 E1100 could perform adequately. Similar to the situation in <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> animals, however, under conditions of inflammatory stress, GLI1 E1100 can only function at 50&#x00025; of the level of WT GLI1. Whether the predisposition to inflammation in these systems is a direct result of lowered HH signal transduction within HH-responsive inflammatory cells or reflects the effect of lower HH signals on other stromal target cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; that, in turn, release signals that impact the integrity of the epithelial layer or the inflammatory phenotype of resident immune cells is not yet clear, and will be an important area of future study. Furthermore, we believe that it will be important to determine if other primary (e.g., germ-line variation in other HH pathway genes and the HH interactome, epigenetic changes, and gene&#x02013;environmental interactions) or secondary phenomena (e.g., due to alterations in commensal flora) in the human/murine intestine alter the transduction of HH signals in response to acute and chronic inflammatory challenge.</p><p>We have additionally shown that the HH pathway may directly modify the innate immune response through signalling to myeloid target cells. This finding is in accord with recent data demonstrating a crucial role for Hh signalling in myeloid cell maturation in the spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, myeloid cell populations are known to modify the intestinal inflammatory milieu through a significant impact on the IL-23/IL-17 pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, a pathway that we find to be clearly and distinctly dysregulated in <italic>Gli1<sup>&#x0002b;/lacZ</sup></italic> inflammation. Taken together, these data raise the exciting possibility that the normal role of HH signalling is to promote a tolerogenic phenotype in mucosal myeloid cells. In the face of reduced HH signal transduction in these cells, minor inflammatory stimuli may trigger robust inflammatory responses. Future studies directly investigating this hypothesis by specifically testing the effects of Hh signalling on intestinal myeloid cells will be crucial to the evolution of a more complete understanding the role of Hh in intestinal inflammation.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>A number of issues meriting further work emerge from the present study. Firstly, deep resequencing of the entire <italic>GLI1</italic> gene is required to identify additional variants that contribute to the overall disease association noted for the gene. Secondly, the in vivo examination of reduced Gli1 function is presently limited to heterozygous mice. Despite the robust phenotype observed in these mice following acute inflammatory challenge, these findings need to be extended to homozygous null mutant animals (<italic>Gli1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>). Thirdly, additional animal models of colitis, particularly of chronic disease, need to be examined; for example, trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced colitis, or adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD45RB<sup>high</sup> T cells into recombinase-activating gene (<italic>rag</italic>)-1 deficient (<italic>rag1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice. Finally, we have not yet directly examined the phenotype of reduced GLI1 function in antigen presenting cells in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A key paradigm emerging in complex disease genetics is that gene discovery may lead to fundamental shifts in the direction of basic and translational research efforts. Recently, it is apparent that mechanistic insights may have greater significance than the index gene discovery itself, especially when one considers the small contribution each locus/variant makes towards disease susceptibility. IBD has provided several recent examples. Notably, the discoveries of <italic>NOD2</italic> and <italic>IL-23R</italic> have launched academic and pharmaceutical research efforts into innate immunity and Th17 signalling, whereas <italic>ATG16L1</italic> and <italic>IRGM</italic> have focused much attention on the role of autophagy in CD pathogenesis. In the present study, our genetic studies led in turn to detailed observations of expression in established human disease as well as a mechanistic study in the mouse. We believe that these combined findings have the potential to open entirely novel lines of enquiry that may have great consequences for the understanding of IBD pathogenesis and potentially for inflammatory pathways in other HH-expressing organs (e.g., skin, lung, bone).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate here the dysregulation of a developmental signalling pathway in IBD for the first time to our knowledge. Furthermore, we show that these effects are in part genetically determined, with evidence implicating <italic>GLI1</italic> as an IBD2 gene, and identification of a specific variant with reduced transcriptional activity. The functional relevance of <italic>Gli1</italic> is demonstrated by the severe intestinal inflammation that develops in the face of a 50&#x00025; reduction in Gli1 concentration in an established mouse model of colitis. Taken together, these data strongly argue that tolerance to inflammatory stimuli requires a fully functional HH signal transduction network. With HH signalling modulators under active investigation in a number of clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.curis.com">http://www.curis.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>), these data provide promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Since the use of HH inhibitors has recently been advocated for the treatment of certain tumours that secrete HH, our finding that reduced HH signalling has inflammatory consequences suggests that inflammatory status should be carefully followed during upcoming Phase II trials &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050239-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Schematic of Activation Events in the HH Signalling Pathway</title><p>There are three mammalian homologues of <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>Hh</italic>, of which SHH and IHH have important functions in the gut and the immune system. Intestinal HH expression is limited to epithelial cells, while HH-response genes are expressed only in intestinal mesenchyme. In epithelial cells, soluble HH is processed in the Golgi and released via Dispatched (DISP1). In the mesenchyme, upon HH binding to the transmembrane receptor PTCH, PTCH can no longer repress SMO, and SMO prevents cleavage of transcription factors GLI2 and GLI3 from activator to repressor form; GLI activator forms then predominate, and transcription is activated in a raft of downstream targets. Direct early targets of HH signals include GLI1, a strong transcriptional activator which acts an amplifier of HH signalling, PTCH, and HHIP, a feedback inhibitor; these markers can be used as indicators of pathway activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050239-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>(66 KB PPT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.0050239.sg001.ppt" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-powerpoint"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050239-sg002"><label>Figure S2</label><caption><title>The Haplotype Structure in <italic>GLI1</italic> and Surrounding Haplotype Blocks Are Presented in Haploview from Genotyping in UC (A) and CD (B)</title><p>There is a haplotype block spanning the <italic>GLI1</italic> gene that does not extend into neighbouring genes.
