Similarly to most DUBs, data on USP25 regulation and substrate recognition is scarce. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis predicted three ubiquitin binding domains (UBDs) at the N-terminus: one ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA) and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs), whereas no clear structural homology at the extended C-terminal region outside the catalytic domains were detected. In order to asses the contribution of the UBDs and the C-terminus to the regulation of USP25m catalytic activity, ubiquitination state and substrate interaction, serial and combinatorial deletions were generated. Our results showed that USP25m catalytic activity did not strictly depend on the UBDs, but required a coiled-coil stretch between amino acids 679 to 769. USP25 oligomerized but this interaction did not require either the UBDs or the C-terminus. Besides, USP25 was monoubiquitinated and able to autodeubiquitinate in a possible loop of autoregulation. UBDs favored the monoubiquitination of USP25m at the preferential site lysine 99 (K99). This residue had been previously shown to be a target for SUMO and this modification inhibited USP25 activity. We showed that mutation of K99 clearly diminished USP25-dependent rescue of the specific substrate MyBPC1 from proteasome degradation, thereby supporting a new mechanistic model, in which USP25m is regulated through alternative conjugation of ubiquitin (activating) or SUMO (inhibiting) to the same lysine residue (K99), which may promote the interaction with distinct intramolecular regulatory domains.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitin (Ub) modifies protein architecture when covalently attached to its substrates.

It is known that the subsequent events are mediated by ubiquitin receptors, which interact with monoubiquitin and/or polyubiquitin chains through small (20&#x02013;150 amino acids) Ub-binding domains (UBDs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Buchberger1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Hicke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. At least fifteen classes of UBDs have been annotated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Hurley1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and this profusion of motifs has launched the study of Ub signalling by: i) providing clues on the roles and modes of action of ubiquitinated substrates, and ii) showing that UBD-containing proteins interact either with Ub or with a ubiquitinated protein. UBD-Ub interactions are usually weak and generate a dynamic protein network that is rapidly assembled and disassembled, thus hindering their study. Moreover, UBDs can modulate the activity of the host protein, as intramolecular interactions between a UBD and a Ub moiety covalently attached to another region of the same protein lead to structural changes that alter the enzymatic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Buchberger1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Hicke1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>UBDs are found not only in proteins that interact with ubiquitinated substrates, but also in ubiquitinating or deubiquitinating enzymes. The deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) hydrolyze the Ub moieties conjugated to substrates and thus, process newly synthesized Ub, recycle Ub, or edit polyUb chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Nijman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Ubiquitination, like phosphorylation, is reversible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Wing1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and, therefore, DUBs can affect the stability and fate of Ub-conjugated proteins, and also allow a tight control of Ub-induced switches. It is assumed that the presence of UBDs in DUBs favor the specific recognition of the ubiquitin modifications, whereas the N- and C-terminal long extensions flanking the DUB-conserved catalytic core may be involved in substrate recognition irrespective of their ubiquitination state.</p><p>Data on the substrate specificity and physiological function of most DUBs, including USP25, are still scanty. <italic>USP25</italic> encodes three different protein isoforms produced by alternative splicing: two of them are expressed ubiquitously, while the longest (USP25m) is restricted to muscle tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Valero1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and is upregulated during myogenesis. Among several sarcomeric substrates, USP25m was reported to specifically interact and rescue MyBPC1 (Myosin Binding Protein C1) from proteasome degradation, thereby raising its cellular half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-BoschComas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We aimed to identify structural domains relevant for USP25m regulation. By <italic>in silico</italic> analysis we identified three potential UBD signatures in the N-terminal region of USP25m. Here, we characterized USP25 by assessing the contribution of these UBDs, as well as the long C-terminal region of USP25, to the catalytic activity. Our results showed that USP25m was monoubiquitinated in cultured cells, and that the UBDs modulated this modification. The preferential site for monoubiquitination is lysine 99 (K99), a residue that has been recently reported to be also the target of sumoylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Meulmeester1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Mohideen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. According to our results, mutation of the K99 residue diminishes the rescue of the specific substrate MyBPC1 from proteasome degradation. In view of these results and those of other authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Meulmeester1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, we propose a novel mechanistic model for USP25m regulation in which the same lysine residue can be either ubiquitinated or sumoylated, and these mutually exclusive modifications have opposite effects on the enzyme activity. This regulatory model bridges the Ub and SUMO pathways and may be extrapolated to other ubiquitin-specific proteases.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutation of the Cys178 catalytic residue abrogates USP25m deubiquitinating activity</title><p>USP25m sequence (1125 aa) alignments revealed five highly conserved distinct motifs (I to V), embedded in two domains (USP1 and USP2) characteristic of the ubiquitin-specific protease family (UBPs, USPs in humans) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Valero1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

The constructs bearing serial deletions of USP25m at the C-terminus are also shown (E679X, E769X, Q863X, E1020X). C. Deubiquitinating activity assays indicated that UBDs were not required to cleave off ubiquitin (left upper panel). The mutant USP25mE679X was unable to hydrolyze Ub from the Ub-&#x003b2;gal substrate, indicating that the region between the amino acids 679 and 769 was required for enzymatic activity (right upper panel).

These extensions have been proposed to be involved in substrate recognition, regulation of the catalytic activity or subcellular localization. USP25 stretches more than 450 amino acids at the C-terminus, including the muscle-specific peptide (introduced by alternative spliced exons 19a and 19b, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005571.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We had previously shown that this tissue-specific peptide (70 amino acids) was required for recognition and rescue from proteasome degradation of sarcomeric substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-BoschComas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, but except for this experimental evidence, the function of this long C-terminus remained unassigned. We decided to perform serial deletions by introducing STOP codons by site-directed mutagenesis at positions E679X, E769X, Q863X and E1020X. As <italic>in silico</italic> searches did not find any functional motif or obvious homology in this region, the positions for the STOP codons were chosen by avoiding to impair secondary structures such as alpha helices or coiled-coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the results obtained with the UBD mutants, the analysis of the serial truncated proteins at the C-terminus of the USP25m protein clearly showed that mutant E679X was incapable of cleaving off the ubiquitin moiety of the Ub-&#x003b2;-gal protein, whereas mutants E769X, Q863X and E1020X still retained the enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g002">Fig. 2C</xref> right panel). Thus, even though the catalytic USP domains relevant for DUBs were present in E679X (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005571.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the deletion of 90 amino acids between E679 and E769 completely abrogated the deubiquitinating activity of USP25. It is worth noting that <italic>in silico</italic> predictions showed a long coiled-coil domain in this region.</p><p>As UBDs have also been involved in shifts in subcellular localization, we asssessed whether the wild-type USP25m and UBD-deleted constructs, either in their catalytically active or inactive forms, showed different localizations. No change in the distribution pattern was observed in any condition, indicating that the UBA and UIM domains were not required for targeting USP25 to its localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005571.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

Therefore, neither the UBDs nor the C-terminus of USP25m were required for this interaction.

This band was stronger when co-expressing His(6x)-Ub, suggesting that it corresponded to mono-ubiquitinated USP25m. The high molecular weight bands were stronger when co-expressing His(6x)-Ub and the catalytically inactive mutant USP25mC178S. The lower histogram shows the percentage of non-modified versus mono-Ub-conjugated USP25m. B. The same experiment was performed co-expressing His(6x)-Ub with all the UBD USP25m deletion mutants, in combination or not with the C178S mutation. Again, the ubiquitinated band was much visible in the C178S version of the mutants. C. Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull-down assays to purify His(6x)Ub-conjugated proteins confirmed that USP25m was ubiquitinated. All the mutant constructs were tested, confirming that monoubiquitination (and multi- or poly-ubiquitination) did not depend on UBDs, neither on the presence of the C-terminus. The ratio output/input is 4. (Output samples were eluted at pH 4.5, which could account for the slight variation in the apparent protein molecular weight compared to inputs). D. Protein stability of the USP25m full-length and mutant constructs. Cells were grown in standard conditions (&#x02212;), or treated with MG132 (&#x0002b;).

The deletion of any UIM and UBA domains, or their combination, prevented, at least partially, USP25m mono-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, upper panel). The mono-ubiquitinated bands were more apparent if the catalytically inactive forms of the deletion constructs were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel). In all deletions and constructs the proportion of modified protein was clearly lower than that of the full-length USP25m.</p><p>To further study USP25m ubiquitination, we performed a Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pull-down assay in cells co-expressing the different USP25 mutants together with His-tagged Ubiquitin. We recovered ubiquitinated USP25m proteins in all UBD deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We also tested the C-terminus deleted USP25m forms; all of them showed intense high molecular-weight bands indicative of mono- and possible multi- or poly-ubiquitination. Noticeably, when testing the mutant that lacked the coiled coil region (E679X), most of the protein was Ub-modified. This result supported the proposed autodeubiquitination activity, as this mutant was catalytically inactive. To discern whether this multiple band pattern was caused by poly-ubiquitination to tag the deleted USP25m proteins to proteasome degradation, we performed an assay of protein stability with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). USP25m full-length as well as the UBD deletion mutants were stable at 16 hours treatment, supporting mono- and multi-Ub modification. In contrast, the protein levels of the C-terminal deletion mutants were clearly increased when the proteasome was inhibited, indicating poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), therefore the most C-terminal region is required for USP25 estabilization.</p><p>To identify the lysine residue involved in the mono-ubiquitination, we co-transfected cells with the mutant USP25mC178S with His(6x)Ub, enriched the lysate in USP25m forms by immunoprecipitation with an anti-cMyc antibody, and analysed the obtained bands by LC-ESI-QTOF mass spectrometry. One Ub-modified peptide appeared consistently, indicating that K99 was the most likely acceptor site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005571-t001">Table 1</xref>). This lysine is located at the beginning of UIM1 and most interestingly, had been previously reported to be the main acceptor for USP25 sumoylation, suggesting a dual regulatory role for this residue. Given that deletion of UIMs, although clearly diminishing USP25 ubiquitination, did not completely preclude it, other less preferential sites might become alternative acceptor sites for

The <italic>in vitro</italic> assay showed that indeed SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 were conjugated to USP25m. In addition, our results in cultured cells revealed that USP25m was phosphorylated (in Tyr and Ser/Thr residues) and acetylated, and that these modifications were independent of USP25m catalytic activity, as the wild-type protein and the inactive mutant were similarly modified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005571.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

We previously reported that the muscle-specific isoform USP25 interacted with MyBPC1, and that the DUB activity of USP25m rescued this substrate from proteasome degradation. This recognition was highly specific and depended on the peptide encoded by the muscle-specific exons 19a and 19b, as the ubiquitous USP25 isoform was unable to rescue this substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-BoschComas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given the reported relevance of UBDs in the regulation of protein folding and modular domain interactions, we were prompted to test the effect of the absence of UBA and/or UIM domains of USP25m in the rescue of MyBPC1 from proteasome degradation.

The activity of the mutants in rescuing MyBPC1 was compared, considering the rescue by the wild-type USP25m as the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Single deletion of the UIM2 did not significantly affect the recognition and rescue of MyBPC1, whereas the deletion of UIM1 (2-fold) or the UBA domains (3-fold) considerably increased the levels of MyBPC1. The double deletion of the UIM1UIM2 decreased the rescue of the substrate. Interestingly, the deletion of the three UBD domains, increased the rescue of MyBPC1 up to 8-fold, indicating that UBDs are not strictly required for MyBPC1 recognition and rescue, but rather they are involved in the enzyme catalytic regulation and/or access to the substrate, probably as a response to cellular requirements. Of note, this deletion not only included the UBDs, but also the SIM domain (SUMO-interacting motif) and the preferential ubiquitin/SUMO target, the residue K99.</p><fig id="pone-0005571-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005571.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>UBDs modulate substrate recognition by USP25m and K99 is the key regulatory residue.</title><p>A.

We have also showed in this work that this residue was also the preferential target for ubiquitination. Given that the two modifications are mutually exclusive, we hypothesized that ubiquitination in K99 would cause the opposite effect, activating USP25. Mutation of K99 to arginine would eliminate the preferential sites for both, sumoylation and ubiquitination, and we could then explore the effect of this mutation in USP25m activity directly on MyBPC1, a physiological substrate. As controls, we used both the wild-type enzyme and the catalytically inactive mutant C178S.</p><p>As expected, the USP25mC178S was not able to rescue MyBPC1 in a time-course experiment, whereas the expression of the wild-type USP25m raised the half-life of MyBPC1, as its levels were steadily maintained through time when protein synthesis was inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-BoschComas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>). Remarkably, USP25mK99R was not able to rescue MyBCP1 from proteasome degradation, as the MyBPC1 levels steadily declined. After 16 h treatment with cicloheximide, the MyBPC1 levels were already decreased to 50&#x00025;, and after 24 h, the levels of MyBPC1 were much lower than those obtained by the wild-type enzyme, although higher than those obtained by the catalytically inactive mutant (statistical significance p&#x0003c;0.05, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005571-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). If the K99 mutation merely prevented sumoylation, and sumoylation inhibited USP25, then we should have expected an increase of DUB activity for the USP25mK99R mutant. However, the fact that the K99R mutant was less effective in rescuing its substrate indicated that the alternative modification of this lysine, namely ubiquitination, resulted in USP25m activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>As DUBs are the least known members of the UPS, we studied the physiological function of USP25 by domain dissection. We particularly focussed in the three predicted UBDs, as these motifs are usually clustered in the same protein and confer subtle differences in the interaction with ubiquitinated substrates. By generating serial and combinatorial deletions, we assessed USP25 protease activity on a recombinant substrate, and showed that all UBD deletion mutants were catalytically active. We concluded that these domains were not strictly required for ubiquitin recognition or the deubiquitinating activity.</p><p>Increasing evidence support that ubiquitin-pathway enzymes (E2&#x02013;E3 ligases, and more recently, DUBs) form cooperative complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Knipscheer1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Ventii1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results indicate that USP25 was able to dimerize/oligomerize. Although most cysteine proteases have not been reported to require oligomerization for catalysis, crystallographic data showed homodimerization for another USP, USP8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Avvakumov1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, providing further grounds for USP25 dimerization. This interaction could occur before or upon substrate binding, and thus provide a means of regulation. In this context, a plausible explanation for the formation of dimers would be USP25 intermolecular autodeubiquitination (see the model below). In addition, dimers/oligomers could facilitate the progressive deubiquitination of a multi- or poly-ubiquitinated substrate, or alternatively, alter the interfaces displayed for substrate recognition.</p><p>One of the reported functions of UBA and UIM sequences is the promotion of ubiquitination of the protein in which they are embedded, thus facilitating autoregulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Woelk1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In the ubiquitin pathway enzymes, feedback self-regulation loops become more complex, as E3 ligases promote their autoubiquitination and DUBs, their autodeubiquination, under certain physiological stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Meek1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Shen1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence for mono- or multi- ubiquitination of USP25m was gathered as a faint high molecular weight band (around 8 kDa larger than that of USP25m) after co-expression of USP25m and ubiquitin. Notably, this band was significantly enriched in lysates of the catalytically inactive USP25mC178S, further suggesting both, that it corresponded to monoubiquitinated forms, and that USP25 catalyzed its own deubiquitination. Mass spectrometry of enriched USP25mC178S samples indicated that USP25 was conjugated to ubiquitin, and that K99 (located in UIM1) was the main target residue. Deletion of the UBDs reduced considerably, but did not abrogate ubiquitination of USP25m, as in all cases ubiquitinated forms were recovered. Thus, the USP25 UBDs, in particular UIM1, enhanced the ubiquitination state of the protein by either providing the preferred lysine residue, directly recruiting E2 or E3 ligases, or both. In the deletion mutants, ubiquitination might take place in alternative lysines with less efficiency. In fact, the use of preferential and alternative lysine residues for mono-ubiquitin conjugation had been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Trotman1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Concerning the ubiquitination state and fate of the wild-type protein and the UBD mutants, we surmised that it corresponded mainly to mono- and multi- ubiquitinated forms, not related to protein degradation, as they were stable through time under our conditions. In contrast, the modification of the C-terminus mutants was compatible with polyubiquitination, as their protein levels were increased when the proteasome was inhibited, pointing to the relevance of the last 106 amino acids in USP25m stability. Polyubiquitination did not appear to be related to the catalytic activity of USP25m as: i) truncated mutants E1020X, Q863X and E769X were enzymatically active but degraded by the proteasome, and ii) of the two catalytically inactive E679X and C178S, the former was polyubiquitinated and degraded, whereas the latter was monoubiquitinated and this modification was not related to degradation. Therefore, autodeubiquitination does not seem to be required for USP25m stability.</p><p>Finally, we assessed the contribution of the UBD deletion mutants to the recognition of the USP25m specific substrate MyBPC1, considering that the requirements for the interaction with a specific physiological substrate might be different from those of a synthetic polyubiquitin substrate. None of the UBDs was critical for enzyme-substrate interaction, as all the mutants rescued the substrate from proteasome degradation. However, the effects were distinct depending on the domains deleted or preserved. The analysis of the contribution of the single and combined domains suggest that the UBA domain negatively modulated the USP25 function mainly by interaction with the UIM1 domain. The effect of the two UIM domains on the substrate rescue appeared to fit an additive/synergical mode of action. Deletion of the three UBDs would effectively remove all these regulatory domains, including those involved in SUMO modification and the target K99. Given that the overexpression of this UBD-deleted USP25 construct caused increased rescue of MyBPC1, we interpreted that the lack of these regulatory domains allowed USP25m free (non-regulated) access to its substrate. UBDs then would mostly contribute to the enzyme regulation in response to cellular requirements rather than to strict substrate recognition.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Model for USP25m regulation: the dual role of K99</title><p>Ubiquitin and SUMO pathways may engage in cross-talk, determining opposite fates or functions of a particular substrate, and even compete for the same residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005571-Ulrich1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.
