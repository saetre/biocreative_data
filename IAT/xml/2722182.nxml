Using an in vitro bystander polarization assay as the readout, we purified and identified the major Th2-inducing component from soluble egg extract (SEA) as the secreted T2 ribonuclease, omega-1. The Th2-promoting activity of omega-1 was found to be sensitive to ribonuclease inhibition and did not require MyD88/TRIF signaling in DCs. In common with unfractioned SEA, the purified native protein suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced DC activation, but unlike SEA, it fails to trigger interleukin 4 production from basophils. Importantly, omega-1&#x02013;exposed DCs displayed pronounced cytoskeletal changes and exhibited decreased antigen-dependent conjugate formation with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that <italic>S. mansoni</italic> omega-1 acts by limiting the interaction of DCs with CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, thereby lowering the strength of the activation signal delivered.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells consist of three major subsets (Th1, Th2, and Th17) that display distinct functions in both host defense and autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhu and Paul, 2008</xref>). The delineation of the signals that trigger differentiation of these CD4 subpopulations is important for the development of interventions based on selective induction or ablation of specific Th responses. The presence of polarizing cytokines at the time of initial CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation is considered to be a primary factor influencing Th phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zhu and Paul, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, under neutral conditions the strength of TCR stimulation can play a critical role in determining Th1 versus Th2 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constant et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosken et al., 1995</xref>). A major approach for studying the basis of Th effector choice has been the analysis of pathogen-induced immune responses that polarize toward Th1, Th2, or Th17 phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ouyang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mouse infection with the trematode <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> is an extensively characterized helminth model for studying Th2 polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearce et al., 2004</xref>). In this system, ova deposited by the parasites in host tissues rather than the worms provide the major Th2 stimulus. Importantly, a water-soluble egg extract (SEA) mimics the key effects of intact ova on Th2 induction. There is growing evidence that the Th2-polarizing activity of SEA is not caused by a direct effect on CD4 T lymphocytes but rather results from prior interaction with DCs. Thus, bone marrow&#x02013;derived DCs (BMDCs) preincubated with SEA trigger potent egg-specific Th2 recall responses after transfer into naive animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MacDonald et al., 2001</xref>). This function does not require DC secretion of IL-4 but instead depends on the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perona-Wright et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to promoting Th2 responses against itself, SEA can trigger bystander Th2 polarization of unrelated antigen in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearce et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perona-Wright et al., 2006</xref>) and in vitro with mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>) or human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Jong et al., 2002</xref>) cells, and in each of the latter assays, DCs play a critical role in determining the Th2 phenotype of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>The mechanism by which helminth-exposed DCs trigger Th2 responses is unclear in terms of the recognition events and signaling pathways involved. Indeed, after SEA exposure only minimal gene activation is observed in DCs, in contrast to the potent and extensive induction seen after Toll-like receptor (TLR)&#x02013;initiated/MyD88-dependent stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, SEA has been shown to actually suppress DC responses to TLR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane et al., 2004</xref>), raising the possibility that its major effects are inhibitory rather than stimulatory.</p><p>Our understanding of the mechanism by which <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs promote Th2 responses has been enormously hindered by a lack of information concerning the identity of the parasite molecules that act on DCs to trigger Th2 polarization. SEA is a complex mixture of hundreds of proteins and glycoconjugates that includes structural components of the miracidial embryo as well as its secretory products. Early work implicated Lewis<sup>X</sup> carbohydrate side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) and complex-type N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faveeuw et al., 2003</xref>) found on multiple schistosome glycoproteins as important Th2 immunomodulatory moieties. In terms of single molecules, IPSE/alpha-1 and peroxiredoxin trigger IgE-dependent IL-4 secretion by basophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schramm et al., 2003</xref>) and induce alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Donnelly et al., 2008</xref>), respectively, but neither are known to directly interact with DCs.</p><p>In the present report we performed a classical biochemical purification of the DC-dependent Th2-polarizing activity in SEA and showed that it can be attributed to a single egg-secreted glycoprotein with ribonuclease activity, <italic>S. mansoni</italic> T2 ribonuclease/omega-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzsimmons et al., 2005</xref>). We further demonstrate that purified omega-1 directly affects both DC morphology and the ability of these APCs to interact physically with CD4 T lymphocytes. Based on this evidence, we propose that SEA and its omega-1 bioactive component promote Th2 polarization by lowering the strength of the activation signal delivered by DCs.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Ribonuclease T2/omega-1 is the major component in <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs that promotes Th2 polarization in vitro</title><p>To identify the egg components that are the triggers and not merely the targets of the Th2 response, we used an in vitro bystander Th polarization assay using OVA-specific transgenic (Tg) CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes that reads out the effects of egg products on DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>). In preliminary studies, the activity in SEA that stimulates DC-dependent Th2 polarization of DO.11.10 Tg lymphocytes was shown to be protease sensitive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082462/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>), and upon gel filtration to be confined to the 10&#x02013;50-kD region of the eluate with the strongest activity correlating with the presence of a band of &#x0223c;30 kD in SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1, B and C). Further purification of the active component was hindered by the heterogeneity and abundance of the proteins in this size range within SEA. To circumvent this problem, we used egg culture supernatants that contain the major secretory products of the miracidial embryo and represent a subset of the total proteins in SEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). These supernatants were highly active in the polarization assay triggering the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes expressing T1/ST2, a marker of Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), as well as IL-4 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Gel filtration of this material yielded a single sharp peak of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>) containing a 32-kD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>), which when eluted from SDS-PAGE gave a 13&#x02013;amino acid N-terminal sequence (QNRWDYYVFSVTxP) identical to that of the previously characterized egg secretory protein omega-1, a T2 ribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzsimmons et al., 2005</xref>). In agreement, both SEA and egg supernatants contained a 32-kD molecule with this enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg culture supernatants promote bystander Th2 polarization.</bold> (A) Protein composition of SEA and egg supernatants evaluated by Coomassie blue&#x02013;stained SDS-PAGE.

Importantly, DEPC treatment, which abolished the Th2-polarizing activity of SEA, also blocked its effects on actin-based DC morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Omega-1&#x02013;exposed DCs display decreased conjugate formation with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title><p>Previous studies demonstrating a role for CD40/CD40L in Th2 induction by SEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacDonald et al., 2002</xref>) and our experiments in which SEA/omega-1 treatment failed to induce Th2 cell differentiation when DCs were separated from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in transwells (unpublished data) suggested that Th2 polarization in this system requires direct DC&#x02013;T cell contact. Because the formation of immunological synapses depends on cytoskeletal polarization at the DC level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Alwan et al., 2003</xref>), we hypothesized that modifications in actin distribution induced by omega-1 might result in altered DC&#x02013;CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell interaction. Accordingly, we tested the ability of omega-1&#x02013;treated DCs to form stable conjugates with CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the presence of nominal peptide. In the assay used, increases in peptide concentration lead to increased numbers of Th cells engaged in conjugate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Qi et al., 2008</xref>), and this interaction is further enhanced by LPS pretreatment of DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, A and B</xref>). In contrast, SEA- or omega-1&#x02013;exposed DCs displayed decreased conjugate formation relative to untreated DCs. Importantly, this reduction was particularly evident at higher peptide concentrations, where the frequency of DC&#x02013;T cell conjugates remained at levels similar to those seen with lower doses of peptide in the absence of any treatment. In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane et al., 2004</xref>), no changes in MHC class II expression were observed in SEA-/omega-1&#x02013;treated DCs (not depicted), arguing against this explanation for reduced DC&#x02013;T cell interaction.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Omega-1&#x02013;exposed DCs are less efficient in forming conjugates with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</bold> (A and B) BMDCs were cultured on nontreated plates with the same stimuli as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>, pulsed with increasing amounts of OVA peptide, and incubated with OT-II Tg CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Consistent with this hypothesis, omega-1 in the presence of an optimal dose of peptide suppressed T cell activation to the level observed with lower peptide concentrations, as evidenced both by the reduced frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells completing the first cell cycle and by their decreased IL-2 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this report establish omega-1 as the principal molecule responsible for the DC-dependent Th2-inducing activity of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> eggs. The key role of omega-1 in schistosome egg Th2 induction is supported by an accompanying report (see Everts et al. on p. <related-article related-article-type="article-reference" vol="206" page="1673" id="d32e628" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="19635864" ext-link-type="pubmed">1673</related-article> of this issue) in which the glycoprotein was shown to condition human DCs for Th2 cell differentiation and to trigger IL-4&#x02013;independent Th2 responses in vivo. Although both studies identify omega-1 as the initial DC trigger, IPSE, a second major egg secretory glycoprotein, is likely to contribute to the Th2 response by providing, through IgE-dependent activation of basophils, an alternative source of IL-4 for sustaining Th2 polarization. A third egg-derived mediator, peroxiredoxin, which lacks a defined signal sequence, may play an additional role by promoting differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages.</p><p>Activation of DCs through TLR is required for Th1 as well as Th17 polarization in many microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medzhitov, 2007</xref>). In contrast, most studies argue for a limited role of TLR signaling in Th2 cell differentiation, and indeed, development of Th2 effectors is commonly associated with suboptimal activation of DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearce et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perona-Wright et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, several <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg components (e.g., Lewis<sup>X</sup>) weakly activate DCs through TLR2, 3, or 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van der Kleij et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy et al., 2005</xref>). Regardless, MyD88-deficient mice undergo normal SEA-induced Th2 polarization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jankovic et al., 2002</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jankovic et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with the latter findings, omega-1 stimulated Th2 cell differentiation in DC cultures from mice doubly deficient in MyD88/TRIF. One possible explanation for these apparently contradictory observations is that although SEA may contain agonists that signal through TLR, the response to these components is actively inhibited by omega-1 in the same fashion as it suppresses the response to LPS.</p><p>The finding that a secreted T2 ribonuclease acts on DCs as a Th2-inducing factor is unexpected, because schistosome eggs contain other molecules such as proteases, which based on prior studies would seem more likely candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donnelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sokol et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, several plant and fungal allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bufe et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bufe et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arruda et al., 1990</xref>) have been identified as ribonucleases. Perhaps more relevant is the recent demonstration by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yang et al. (2008)</xref> that the human eosinophil&#x02013;derived neurotoxin, a ribonuclease A, acts as an endogenous alarmin that enhances Th2 responses by directly affecting DCs. Ribonuclease activity is often associated with cytotoxicity, and indeed, omega-1 was initially characterized as a hepatotoxic agent from <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fitzsimmons et al., 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the Th2-promoting activity of omega-1 in our culture system cannot be explained by cytotoxic effects, because the molecule failed to induce a detectable reduction in DC viability. The precise role that the enzymatic activity of omega-1 plays in its Th2-promoting function is currently under study.</p><p>Our finding that SEA and purified omega-1 both profoundly modify the cytoskeletal organization of DCs implicates a role for altered cell morphology in the Th2-promoting function of these cells. Indeed, the cytoskeletal alterations observed closely correlated with decreased DC&#x02013;CD4 conjugate formation as well as impaired T cell activation, suggesting that omega-1/SEA exposure creates a setting of weak TCR signal strength analogous to that seen with low-dose antigen. Although we cannot rule out other mechanisms for the immunomodulatory activity of omega-1, this hypothesis provides a framework for resolving a previously noted inconsistency in the signal strength concept as an explanation for helminth-induced Th2 polarization. Thus, helminths release large amounts of parasite products that should generate conditions for high- rather than low-dose antigen effects. In the case of <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection, for example, female worms deposit as many as 300 eggs per day, leading to high concentrations of circulating antigen. However, in the presence of omega-1 and possibly other helminth-functional homologues, this high dose of antigen would be offset by inhibition of DC&#x02013;CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell encounter, thus resulting in a decreased signal strength equivalent to that seen with low antigen doses. Further studies on defined helminth Th2-inducing factors will be important in establishing the general validity of this proposed mechanism for parasite-induced Th2 polarization.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Animals.</title><p>C57BL/6 and BALB/c WT mice were obtained from Taconic.
