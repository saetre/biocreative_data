From cDNA microarray analysis of locally advanced breast carcinomas, Perou and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] identified five subgroups based on their distinct gene expression patterns. The subgroups were shown to differ with respect to outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and have also been identified in other datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. van't Veer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] analyzed node-negative breast cancer patients under the age of 55 years using DNA microarrays and identified a 'poor prognosis signature' that predicted short interval to distant metastasis. A larger set of samples was studied by van de Vijver and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] to confirm the predictive value of this signature in women under 53 years of age. Other datasets have been analyzed with similar findings of molecular subgroups with different clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, there are few published studies with a relatively large number of patients with long-term follow-up.</p><p>Several well-established clinical, histopathological and molecular factors are today used as prognostic and predictive markers of breast cancer. These include patient age, tumor size, lymph node status, presence of distant metastasis (TNM-stage; tumor, node, metastasis), histological type, tumor grade, and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and ERBB2/HER-2 status. Improvements of prognostic criteria have been achieved by optimally combining available markers. The National Cancer Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and St Gallen Conference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] provide adjuvant treatment guidelines based on these markers. Currently, TNM-staging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], the Nottingham Prognostic Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and Adjuvant Online [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] are the most commonly used integrated prognostic models.</p><p><italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status is rarely obtained for routine analysis, despite accumulating evidence of its prognostic value. Mutations in the <italic>TP53 </italic>gene have been reported to be present in more than half of all cancer cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; however, the frequency shows variation between types/subtypes of cancer. In breast cancer, the frequency of <italic>TP53 </italic>gene mutations is approximately 20% to 30%. Acquiring a <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation has been suggested to be an early event in breast cancer development and it is related to poor prognosis and chemo resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Allelic imbalance (AI) (or loss of heterozygosity (LOH)) at chromosome location 17p13, where the <italic>TP53 </italic>gene is located, has been reported in more than half of breast carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Traditionally, AI is considered as an additional event eliminating the <italic>TP53 </italic>tumor suppressor function.</p><p>In this study we address the question of whether gene expression profiles offer better prognostic information in patients with long-term follow-up. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of seven standard markers and <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status for the total group of breast cancer patients. We then analyzed a large subset of these tumors using cDNA microarrays and assigned the samples to five previously defined molecular expression groups. The strength of gene expression-based classification versus standard markers was evaluated by adding this variable to the Cox regression model used to analyze all samples. This is the first report that includes both gene expression groups and <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status in a multivariate analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Patient material</title><p>A series of 212 primary breast cancer cases were studied; 80 of these tumors were analyzed using cDNA microarrays, along with one normal breast tissue sample collected from breast reduction surgery. Patient samples were sequentially collected at Ullev&#x000e5;l University Hospital from 1990 to 1994 (IRB approval 350, protocol 75026). The last update of patient information was done in 2006, providing an observation time of 12 to 16 years. Patients were followed until death or emigration, and only 12 patients were lost to follow-up. The average age of the 80 cases analyzed by cDNA microarrays was 65.0 years at time of primary surgery (range 28.2 to 87.7 years), similar to the average age of 64.4 years (range 28.2 to 91.5 years) for the total series. The 80 cases were selected from the total series based only on sufficient amount of fresh frozen tissue for microarray analysis. Consequently, a slightly higher fraction of patients with larger tumor size was observed in this subcohort. A summary of the clinical and histopathological data of the patients is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> for more detailed information). All patients were treated according to Norwegian national guidelines at the time of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Patients receiving adjuvant systemic therapy were given nine courses of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil) and/or Tamoxifen for two years. Dosage of radiation given as adjuvant treatment was dependent on indication; after breast conserving therapy the mammary gland was given 50 Gy (2 Gy &#x000d7; 25). The number of samples entered into the survival analyses is smaller than 212 (full dataset) and 80 (subset with gene expression data); excluding patients with missing information or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and primary surgery, leaves us with a maximum number of 200 (full set) and 77 (subset) patients.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table

The majority of samples (80%) analyzed using microarrays had at least 40% tumor cell content. Sections from paraffin embedded tissue were re-evaluated by an experienced breast pathologist (JMN) to classify and grade the carcinomas according to the modified Scarff-Bloom-Richardson method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>TP53 </italic>and hormone-receptor analysis</title><p>DNA was isolated from both peripheral blood cells (leukocytes) and tumor tissue using chloroform/phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation (Nuclear Acid Extractor 340A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) according to standard procedures. <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation detection in tumor DNA was performed by prescreening exon 2&#x02013;11 using temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Samples with aberrant migrating bands from TTGE were sequenced (ABI PRISM&#x02122; 377 DNA Sequencer, Applied Biosystems) to determine the nature of the mutation.

At least one of the polymorphic markers had to show AI to score positive. The ER and PR were analyzed using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and biochemical/ligand-binding assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA).

The concentration of total RNA was determined using an HP 8453 spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard) and the integrity of the RNA was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, USA). Linear amplification of total RNA was performed using an optimized protocol previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Amplified tumor RNA was labeled by Cy5 and amplified RNA from Universal Human Reference total RNA (Stratagene<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, La Jolla, California, USA) was labeled by Cy3. The labeling and hybridization of amplified RNA to cDNA microarrays, containing more than 42,000 elements, was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Experimental protocols can be found at the referred web site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Images of the arrays was acquired using a Gene Pix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, California, USA), and analyzed using Gene Pix Pro 3.0/4.0/4.1 software and by visual inspection. Data were entered in the Stanford Microarray Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and intensity levels were normalized. Data were filtered for spot quality and included in the analysis if the pixels within a spot showed a regression correlation of at least 0.6 or if the signal intensity of both sample and reference were at least 1.5 over background. A hierarchical clustering algorithm integrated into the Stanford Microarray Database was applied to group genes and samples on the basis of their similarities in expression, and the results were visualized using TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Java TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] software (for analysis software links, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). Prior to clustering analysis, the data were centered to median expression of each gene across the dataset. The hierarchical clustering shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> was performed using previously described 'intrinsic' genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] consisting of 540 clones (representing 496 genes corresponding to a single unique UniGene cluster) whose expression was measurable in at least 70% of the samples. The 'intrinsic' set of genes consisted of genes with significantly greater variation in expression between different tumors than between paired samples from the same tumor, the name reflecting that genes were selected to optimally identify intrinsic characteristics of breast tumors.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Hierarchical clustering using 'intrinsic' genes. <bold>(a) </bold>Five groups were identified, namely the highly proliferating luminal (light blue), luminal A (dark blue), normal-like (green), basal-like (red) and ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>(magenta) groups, which were used in the survival analysis. <bold>(b) </bold>Hierarchical clustering was performed using 540 clones, representing 496 unique genes from the 'intrinsic' gene list.

A parsimonious Cox regression model with only significant factors was obtained by backwards elimination starting with all factors, and the final model was checked for all possible two-factor interactions.

The resulting dendrogram showed two main groups of breast tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); those with high expression of the ER-related gene cluster and luminal type characteristics (left branch), and those showing a lower relative expression of the ER-related cluster (right branch). Further subdivision of the samples identified five groups similar to those previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] also in this set of breast tumors. The correlation between the gene expression profile of each sample and five previously described centroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] were calculated and a scatter chart was made (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) according to the order of samples in the dendrogram from hierarchical clustering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The correlation of each sample to each of the centroids showed a continuous wave pattern over the sample set, and visualized how each sample carries elements from different profiles.

The subgroups that showed the poorest survival had the largest difference in median age, members of the basal-like and ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>groups being the youngest (median age 56 years (28 to 75) and 60 years (47 to 87), respectively) and those of the highly proliferating luminal group the oldest (median age 75 years (59 to 82)). Dividing the patients into two equally large groups (&#x0003c;65 years and &#x02265;65 years) gave a significant skewed distribution between the five gene expression groups (<italic>p </italic>= 0.019), but there was no significant difference when dividing them into pre- and post-menopausal women (&#x0003c;55 years and &#x02265;55 years) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Tumor size did not show a statistically significant skewed distribution between the gene expression groups, suggesting that the gene expression patterns provide new and different information compared to this established marker. Neither was node status associated with any particular gene expression group.</p><p>The histological type and grade, as well as ER and <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status all showed a highly significant skewed distribution between the gene expression groups (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>and basal-like groups showed the highest fraction of grade 3 tumors (80% and 58%, respectively). Although carcinomas of the luminal A and highly proliferating luminal subgroups were mainly grade 2, they differed by the fact that the luminal A group included 22% of cases with grade 1 and no grade 3 cases, while the highly proliferating luminal group included 27% of cases with grade 3 and no grade 1 cases. Among the luminal samples, 89% were ER positive, while none of the basal-like and only 30% of the ERBB2<sup>+</sup>-group were ER positive. The relative mRNA expression of ER (centered over the dataset) was compared to protein expression (IHC) and showed a strong correlation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tumor cell content and histological types</title><p>Tissue samples with a low fraction of malignant epithelial cells were included in this study to increase our understanding of how this may affect a tumor's characteristic gene expression pattern. Samples with different percentages of malignant epithelial cells were distributed among all subclasses, although an over-representation (not statistically significant) of tumors with low tumor content were seen in the normal-like subgroups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The invasive lobular carcinomas tended to have lower tumor content than invasive ductal carcinomas. Hierarchical clustering of samples with &#x02265;40% tumor cells results in the same subgroups as when all samples were included. These results suggest that the gene expression profile of a grossly dissected tumor sample in many cases is not heavily influenced by a relatively low quantity of malignant cells, and that tumor stromal cells also may affect the gene expression profile.</p><p>Invasive ductal carcinomas were distributed among all subclusters, but entirely dominated the highly proliferating luminal, basal-like and ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Invasive lobular carcinomas were divided into two groups, those clustering with the normal-like subgroup, previously referred to as 'typical-lobular' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and the 'ductal-like lobular' clustering with the two luminal groups (14/22 and 7/22, respectively). The only lobular samples clustering on the edge of the basal-like group were alveolar lobular with pleomorphic areas. Two tubulolobular carcinomas clustered together in the highly proliferating luminal subgroup, and three mucinous carcinomas clustered together in the luminal A subgroup, showing that the phenotypes distinguished by pathologists are also distinct on a molecular level. A fourth sample, an invasive ductal carcinoma, was part of the 'mucinous cluster,' showing a gene expression pattern similar to these tumors despite the fact that no typical mucinous elements in paraffin-embedded or frozen tissue sections from this patient were seen. The mucinous samples were all ER positive by IHC, <italic>TP53 </italic>wild type, ERBB2 negative and E-cadherin positive. A ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ </italic>with microinvasion and a metaplastic carcinoma clustered in the normal-like subgroup. The invasive ductal carcinoma sample from a man (ULL-020) clustered with the highly proliferating luminal group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the patient series analyzed here both uni- and multivariate analysis show that <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status was a very pronounced prognostic factor. Although some studies have reported similar findings, others have found a weaker prognostic power for <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which may be due to the mutation screening approach used (as well as population differences). The most frequently used method for mutation screening of the <italic>TP53 </italic>gene has been IHC, which detects only mutations that induce protein accumulation, missing frameshift, nonsense and splice mutations. In this study, several of the missense mutations with high levels of mRNA expression were also missed by IHC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), showing the insufficiency of this technique for mutation screening. The TTGE/sequencing analysis detected 15% of the <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations outside exons 5 to 8, supporting the importance of analyzing the whole gene and not only exons 5 to 8 as many previous studies have done.</p><p>A key issue is whether <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status is a prognostic marker or instead a marker of therapy response only (predictive marker). The results in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> (Multivariate analysis) show the total effects of tumor size and <italic>TP53 </italic>status on survival, effects that may be direct and/or indirect via adjuvant treatment. When including adjuvant therapy in the multivariate analysis, RR values similar to those in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> were found (<italic>TP53</italic>, RR 5.1), indicating that the total effects are mainly a result of the direct effects, not indirect effects via treatment. Analysis of patients receiving surgery only (no adjuvant treatment) also gave similar result (<italic>TP53</italic>, RR 4.3). Although several studies have suggested that <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status is a predictive factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], randomized large-scale studies are needed to make certain of this. <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status may be both a predictive marker of some treatment regimes as well as a strong prognostic factor.</p><p>The strong correlation of <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations with the basal-like subtype is a biologically important finding, and whether it is the nature of ER-negative basal-like tumors that allows mutational events in the <italic>TP53 </italic>gene or that the basal-like gene expression profile is a consequence only of a <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation is unresolved and should stimulate further investigation on the origin of breast tumor cells. A related question to address in larger studies is whether the specific gene expression pattern we found associated with <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status was a result of cellular events directly initiated by mutant <italic>TP53 </italic>or rather a result of the dominant cell type (basal-like progenitor or cancer stem cell) in these tumors. Similar questions apply to the ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>subtype, which also shows a strong correlation with <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations; in addition, the sequence and impact of the ERBB2 amplification versus the <italic>TP53 </italic>mutational event needs investigation. S&#x000f8;rlie and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] reported in their patient cohort of locally advanced breast cancer a high frequency of <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations also within the luminal B samples (highly proliferating luminal cases). A relatively low frequency of <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations was found within the highly proliferating luminals (2/15) in our set of patients with earlier stage tumors. We propose that <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations may be an early and causal event in basal-like tumors whereas in luminal B (highly proliferating luminals) tumors it may be a consequence of genomic instability. The strong association found between AI and point mutations in the <italic>TP53 </italic>gene in the basal-like and ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>samples support the concept of <italic>TP53 </italic>acting as a tumor suppressor gene in these tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], while the high frequency of AI despite a low frequency of <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations in the highly proliferating luminal group suggests a different mechanism for <italic>TP53 </italic>in these tumors.</p><p>There is a massive interest in defining gene expression profiles of breast tumors to understand the development and progression of the disease and to create a novel clinically useful diagnostic tool. Many reports are very promising, although the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the disease does not make it straightforward to predict recurrence and outcome in individuals based on a snapshot of the biological processes in the individual tumor. Our study aimed to investigate the potential of gene expression profiling as a prognostic marker in patients with long term follow-up, and not to create yet another gene list associated with patient outcome. The extreme amount of variables (genes) and the relatively low number of cases and events increases the probability of accidental but apparently significant findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] in microarray analysis. In this study we have chosen an unsupervised approach for the classification of samples. The results certainly support the huge potential of information found in expression patterns, and the classification is shown to be a statistically highly significant predictor of survival.</p><p>The Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>) illustrates a significant difference in survival between the different expression groups, as seen in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Notice that the two groups with very poor prognosis had a diverse progression of disease. Breast cancer cases in both the basal-like and ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>groups had a very high mortality rate during the first two years, while the highly proliferating luminal cases developed the disease more slowly, showing highest mortality after five to eight years. We were not able to pinpoint any specific heterogeneity (clinical, histopathological or molecular markers) of the patients within the highly proliferating luminal cluster, the group showing non-proportional hazard, and suggest the curve reflects biological characteristics. Many patients with highly proliferating luminal cancer received Tamoxifen treatment for two years, and the poor outcome in this group compared to luminal A patients could be explained by the lack of a Tamoxifen effect. Alternatively, this anti-estrogen treatment may temporarily prolong patient survival in this group for the first years they receive the drug. The different progression observed in basal-like versus highly proliferating luminal patients may be consistent with the bimodal mortality rate reported by Demicheli and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Different approaches have been used in an attempt to define clinically relevant groups based on gene expression patterns, but a consensus on how to do this has not yet been reached. In our study a classification similar to the one identified by S&#x000f8;rlie and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] was obtained, supporting the existence of such subgroups in a broader spectrum of breast tumor stages. A few samples were, for various reasons, difficult to categorize. The lack of proliferation genes in the intrinsic gene list causes a less clear correlation with the luminal B centroid, but when proliferation genes from the total cluster (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1h</xref>) were included the characteristics of the highly proliferating luminals (luminal B-like) compared to the luminal A group were clearly shown. Although the majority of luminal samples were most highly correlated with the luminal A-centroid, the group we named highly proliferating luminals is clearly different from the luminal A group in the scatter chart, having the second highest correlation with the luminal B-centroid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). We suggest that earlier stages of luminal B (here named highly proliferating luminals) may have less pronounced expression profiles than the advanced tumors where the centroids were defined (our data set versus S&#x000f8;rlie and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The small cluster between the normal-like and the basal-like group shows highest correlation with the ERBB2-centroid, although this group demonstrates extremely low expression of both the ERBB2 gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>) and basal-like genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>). The samples seem more normal-like based on the fact that a normal breast tissue sample clustered within this group, as well as showing expression of genes previously identified to characterize normal-like samples. This small cluster illustrates the difficulties in assigning individual samples to subgroups based on correlation with centroids alone. The correlation of each sample with each of the centroids showed a continuous pattern over the sample set, and visualizes how each sample carries elements from different profiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1g</xref>, the ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>group on the far right side shows high expression of an ERBB2-related gene cluster and is, therefore, included in this group, despite the fact that its members also show correlation with the luminal B centroid. It is a matter of choice which group to assign these samples to. The ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>group is defined by a molecular event (overexpression of ERBB2), whereas the luminal B group is recognized by highly proliferating ER-positive tumors. Three samples do not show increased ERBB2 expression, but they are included in the ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>group based on their clustering. Although these samples express a low level of ERBB2 on the RNA level, it has been observed that the protein level (fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis) does not always correspond and thus may be high.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The combination of gene expression groups and clinical/histopathological parameters in this study has added more details and levels of understanding to our current picture of breast carcinomas. The long follow-up of patients revealed that the highly proliferating luminal group had an even worse prognosis than the basal-like and the ERBB2<sup>+ </sup>groups. The relatively good outcome for the first five years for the highly proliferating luminal group may be explained by the natural history of these tumors or by use of Tamoxifen. The strong association found between the basal-like group and <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations suggests that such mutations may be causal in these tumors, while <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations may be a later event in the highly proliferating luminal carcinomas. The high frequency of <italic>TP53 </italic>AI in the highly proliferating luminal group supports a mechanism other than <italic>TP53 </italic>mutations causing genomic instability in these tumors, and should be further explored. The characteristic gene expression pattern found in tumors carrying a <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation also needs further investigation in larger sets of samples with various mutations included.</p><p>Both <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation status and gene expression subgroups demonstrated strong prognostic impact, and may add valuable new information that complements the established prognostic markers. <italic>TP53 </italic>may help distinguish high risk tumors in need of treatment from among small, node negative tumors, which do not currently receive adjuvant treatment (that is, they are undertreated); on the other hand, it may help avoid treatment of individuals in patient groups that today may be overtreated. The choice of treatment may, for example, be influenced by avoiding drugs dependent on <italic>TP53</italic>-mediated apoptosis or, in the future, by using drugs that target and reactivate <italic>TP53</italic>. Although gene expression-based subgroups showed massive prognostic strength, a more robust classification method is needed for future application in clinical practice. Development of a new integrated prognostic model that includes <italic>TP53 </italic>and gene expression groups could be useful in the choosing of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AI = allelic imbalance; CMF = cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil; ER = estrogen receptor; IHC = immunohistochemistry; LOH = loss of heterozygosity; PR = progesterone receptor; RR = relative risk; SAM = significance analysis of microarray; TTGE = temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AL collected updated clinical data, participated in revising the histology, carried out the gene expression analysis, organized the <italic>TP53 </italic>mutation analysis, participated in the design of the study, performed some statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
