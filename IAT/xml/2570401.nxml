Despite considerable study during the past decade, it is still not well understood why soluble IAPP molecules form toxic IAPP aggregates in type 2 diabetes. The presence of an amyloidogenic amino acid sequence in the human IAPP molecule (Gly-Ala-Iso-Leu-Ser &#x0005b;GAILS&#x0005d;) appears to be important but not sufficient for amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>). Because production and secretion of IAPP closely mimic that of insulin, IAPP levels are elevated in conditions associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, such as the early stages of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>). Elevated IAPP production and secretion because of increased demand for insulin along with defective trafficking and/or processing of proIAPP associated with &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction have been implicated as two possible factors contributing to aggregation of (pro)IAPP (i.e., proIAPP and its intermediate forms) in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>).</p><p>Studies performed using transgenic rodent models have demonstrated a strong association between &#x003b2;-cell expression of human IAPP and development of hyperglycemia associated with loss of &#x003b2;-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>). &#x003b2;-Cell loss in these models was attributed to the formation of toxic IAPP aggregates as either small oligomeric species or amyloid fibrils. Studies on human and nonhuman primates have also demonstrated development of islet amyloid associated with &#x003b2;-cell loss in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>). It is not clear from these studies, however, whether IAPP aggregation and amyloid formation is the cause or a consequence of &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction and death. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of human IAPP expression would inhibit amyloid formation and enhance survival and/or function of human islets. We and others have found that islet amyloid forms rapidly in islets from transgenic mice with &#x003b2;-cell expression of human IAPP, and its formation is potentiated by elevated glucose concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>).

Transduced COS-1 cells were then transfected with pSuper-hProIAPP-siRNA. Transduction efficiency with Ad-hProIAPP-EGFP, as assessed by detection of COS-1 cells expressing GFP 36 h after transduction, was &#x0223c;70&#x00025;. Transfection efficiency with the siRNA construct was &#x0223c;60&#x00025;, as estimated by detection of fluorescence in COS-1 cells transfected with pSuper-siRNA-GFP, a plasmid with a similar construct that expresses GFP. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>), expression of fibrillogenic human proIAPP in COS-1 cells resulted in an increase in the number of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), whereas adenoviral expression of nonamyloidogenic rat proIAPP was not toxic (data not shown). Transfection with pSuper-hProIAPP-siRNA markedly decreased the number of GFP-expressing cells, indicating effective suppression by the siRNA of the expression of the proIAPP-EGFP fusion protein in cells transduced with Ad-hProIAPP-EGFP. Interestingly, inhibition of adenoviral-mediated human proIAPP expression by transfection with pSuper-hProIAPP-siRNA was associated with a marked decrease in the number of apoptotic COS cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>ProIAPP gene silencing in human islets by an siRNA-expressing adenovirus.</title><p>To determine whether suppression of IAPP synthesis will inhibit amyloid formation and enhance survival of &#x003b2;-cells, we generated an adenovirus to deliver a specific human proIAPP siRNA (Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA) into &#x003b2;-cells in isolated human islets. The siRNA construct that was found to provide the most effective suppression of proIAPP in COS-1 cells (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) was chosen for generation of Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA as described in <sc>research design and methods</sc>. Isolated human islets were transduced with Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA or a control adenovirus expressing a random siRNA (Ad-Cont-siRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>) overnight (16 h) and cultured in CMRL with 11.1 mmol/l glucose for up to 10 days. IAPP-immunoreactive forms were detected by Western blot 10 days after transduction. As expected, mature IAPP (&#x0223c;4 kDa) was the major IAPP-immunoreactive form detected in preculture isolated human islets. Interestingly, after a 10-day culture, the major detectable (pro)IAPP form in human islets was a partially processed &#x0223c;6 kDa intermediate form (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting that prolonged culture in elevated glucose concentrations impairs proIAPP processing, in accordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).

To this end, we double stained islet sections for insulin and TUNEL. Many insulin/TUNEL double-positive islet cells were apparent in sections of nontransduced cultured human islets (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Although insulin/TUNEL double-positive islet cells were also observed in Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA transduced islets, these appeared lower in frequency (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>right</italic>). A higher magnification view of these cells revealed that they were TUNEL positive and insulin positive (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of IAPP expression in cultured human islets decreases &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis.</p><p>Notably, many TUNEL-positive cells in cultured human islets were found to be insulin negative (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Although many of these cells may be non&#x02013;&#x003b2;-cells, we suspect that the majority of TUNEL-positive, insulin-negative cells in our islet cultures are &#x003b2;-cells that have lost detectable insulin staining while undergoing cell death. To evaluate this possibility, we next double immunostained, for insulin and glucagon, sections of cultured islets that had been transduced with Ad-hProIAPP-siRNA or Ad-Cont-siRNA or left untreated and quantified the ratio of &#x003b2;- to &#x003b1;-cells as a measure of &#x003b2;-cell&#x02013;specific loss (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). siRNA-mediated inhibition of IAPP expression was associated with a 33&#x00025; increase in the ratio of &#x003b2;- to &#x003b1;-cells compared with nontransduced islets (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Transduction with an Ad-Cont-siRNA did not have any significant effect on the &#x003b2;-cell&#x02013;to&#x02013;&#x003b1;-cell ratio. These data demonstrate that inhibition of IAPP expression preserves &#x003b2;-cells in cultured human islets.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of human proIAPP synthesis increases insulin content and enhances &#x003b2;-cell function in cultured human islets.</title><p>To determine whether siRNA-mediated prevention of amyloid formation and islet cell death enhances &#x003b2;-cell function in cultured human islets, we measured insulin content and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in human islets after 10-day culture. Adenoviral siRNA-mediated inhibition of proIAPP synthesis was associated with an increase in islet insulin content and higher levels of insulin secretion after stimulation with 16.7 mmol/l glucose for 1 h (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Human islets transduced with Ad-Cont-siRNA had insulin content and GSIS that were similar to untreated controls (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Progressive loss of islet &#x003b2;-cell mass and function is a key defect in type 2 diabetes, ultimately leading to &#x003b2;-cell failure. The decrease in &#x003b2;-cell mass in type 2 diabetes results primarily from increased &#x003b2;-cell death via apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>), and formation of toxic IAPP aggregates is thought to be an important contributor to the progressive loss of &#x003b2;-cells in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>). It remains unclear whether aggregation of IAPP and amyloid formation is a cause of &#x003b2;-cell loss or simply a marker of &#x003b2;-cell death and dysfunction. Here, we show, using a human islet culture model, that suppression of human IAPP expression inhibits islet amyloid formation and enhances survival and function of islet &#x003b2;-cells. These findings provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that aggregation of IAPP leads to &#x003b2;-cell death in human islets in situ and point to inhibition of IAPP expression as a potential therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Islet amyloid may take years to form in the type 2 diabetic pancreas, but recent reports have described rapid amyloid formation in islets of human IAPP transgenic mice after prolonged culture or after transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>) and after transplantation of human islets into immune-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>). Here, we show that human islets, when cultured in moderately elevated glucose concentrations, rapidly develop amyloid associated with cell death. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that rapid amyloid formation might be a contributing factor to &#x003b2;-cell demise during culture or after transplant. Targeting IAPP expression might therefore have value to improve viability of human islets during pretransplant culture and after transplantation.</p><p>Although cultured human islets provide a useful model for studies on islet amyloid formation and &#x003b2;-cell death, this experimental model may not completely mimic the conditions in the type 2 diabetic human pancreas. One possible explanation underlying the rapid amyloid formation in cultured human islets is that clearance of proIAPP from the islet after its secretion may be impaired in isolated islets, occurring via diffusion rather than perfusion of the islet vasculature as occurs in vivo. Prolonged residence in the islet after secretion from &#x003b2;-cells may then allow more time for IAPP to accumulate and aggregate. A second possibility is that processing of the IAPP precursor, proIAPP, may become impaired in islets during prolonged culture, manifest as accumulation of an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminally extended proIAPP processing intermediate (see <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). We and others have recently demonstrated that impaired NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal processing of proIAPP leads to fibril formation and cell death in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>). It is possible that the culture conditions used, including high glucose (11 mmol/l), induce impaired processing of proIAPP, leading to accumulation of misfolded forms of the precursor in the ER and other intracellular compartments. Alternatively, secretion of incompletely processed proIAPP may lead to its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>) and its accumulation in the intracellular space. Whether the mechanism underlying rapid amyloid formation in cultured human islets resembles that in type 2 diabetes remains to be determined.</p><p>The proportion of TUNEL-positive cells after 10-day culture was &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the total number of islet cells and reduced to &#x0223c;10&#x00025; by adenoviral expression of human IAPP siRNA. This high proportion of TUNEL-positive cells is similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>) and suggests a high incidence of cell death occurring in human islets during normal culture conditions. In vivo, apoptotic &#x003b2;-cells are rapidly cleared by macrophages, and cells are only transiently TUNEL positive, but in vitro apoptotic cells are not cleared and therefore likely remain TUNEL positive for much longer. Therefore, the number of TUNEL-positive islet cells at day 10 of culture is probably reflective of cumulative cell death over the preceding few days.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that IAPP-induced cell toxicity is mediated not by amyloid per se but primarily by smaller aggregates of IAPP, termed protofibrils or oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>). These studies raise the important consideration that any therapeutic approach targeting IAPP and amyloid formation should not increase the proportion of these smaller toxic species. Another recently proposed mechanism suggests that growth of IAPP-derived fibrils at the cell membrane induces cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>). Because inhibition of IAPP expression is upstream of the earliest events in IAPP aggregation, our siRNA approach is predicted to inhibit the formation of both oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The marked improvements in cell viability that we observed point to the validity of IAPP synthesis as a target for preservation of human islet cells.</p><p>Given the potential toxicity of adenoviral infection of islet cells and the potential for nonspecific effects of siRNA expression, it is important in any such study to include appropriate controls. In this study, we also assessed amyloid formation and islet cell toxicity in cells transduced with the same MOI of adenovirus expressing a random siRNA, and we observed no differences in amyloid area, proportion of TUNEL-positive cells, insulin content, and secretion. This finding strongly suggests that the beneficial impact of adenoviral expression of human proIAPP siRNA in islets cells was due to siRNA-mediated inhibition of IAPP expression.</p><p>In summary, using cultured human islets as an ex vivo model of rapid islet amyloid formation, we showed that siRNA-mediated inhibition of human (pro)IAPP synthesis effectively prevents amyloid formation and enhances human &#x003b2;-cell survival and function. Assuming appropriate vehicles for delivery of siRNA to islets in vivo may become available in the future, this approach has therapeutic potential for preservation of &#x003b2;-cell mass in type 2 diabetes. In the meantime, targeting proIAPP expression in human islets ex vivo has potential immediate application in enhancing preculture transplant of human islets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>L.M. is the recipient of a Postdoctoral Fellowship Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.
