The Notch signaling pathway has long been thought to be mono-directional, because ligands for Notch were generally believed to be unable to transmit signals into the cells expressing them. However, we showed here that Notch also supplies signals to neighboring mouse neural stem cells (NSCs). To investigate the Notch&#x02013;Delta signaling pathway in a bi-directional manner, we analyzed functional roles of the intracellular domain of mouse Delta like protein 1 (Dll1IC). In developing mouse NSCs, Dll1IC, which is released from cell membrane by proteolysis, is present in the nucleus. Furthermore, we screened for transcription factors that bind to Dll1IC and demonstrated that Dll1IC binds specifically to transcription factors involved in TGF-<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>/Activin signaling&#x02014;Smad2, Smad3 and Smad4&#x02014;and enhances Smad-dependent transcription. In addition, the results of the present study indicated that over-expression of Dll1IC in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells induced neurons, and this induction was blocked by SB431542, which is a specific inhibitor of TGF-<bold>&#x003b2;</bold>/Activin signaling.

The Notch signaling pathway has long been thought to be mono-directional, because ligands for Notch were generally considered unable to transmit signals into the cells expressing these ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Several lines of evidence support this idea. For example, it was thought that none of the intracellular domains of putative Notch ligands display any significant sequence similarity throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Indeed, replacement of most of the intracellular domain of LAG-2, a C. elegans lin-12 (Notch) ligand, with a &#x003b2;-galactosidase fusion protein has no discernible effect on LAG-2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In contrast, however, Baker and Schubiger reported that the extracellular domain of Notch expressed in the mesoderm provided a positive signal to the overlaying ectoderm in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that the intracellular domain of Delta (X-Delta-1) is required for normal development in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was also shown that intracellular domains of these ligands act as antagonists of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These findings suggest that signaling in the opposite direction also exists. Thus, the important and critical question is whether signaling events occur not only from ligand-expressing cells to Notch-expressing cells but also vice versa, i.e. in a bi-directional manner.</p><p>Evidence has recently been accumulating in support of a functional role of the intracellular domains of Notch ligands, which implies the existence of bi-directional signaling mechanisms. For example, Delta has been shown to be cleaved by ADAM protease and &#x003b3;-secretase to release an intracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). This processing followed a mechanism of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), which was first described for the proteolytic activation of Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The RIP mechanism requires sequential cleavage steps to occur within the juxtamembrane (JM) and transmembrane (TM) domain, which are carried out by an ADAM protease and Presenilin &#x003b3;-secretase, respectively. In the case of Notch, RIP serves to release an intracellular domain that has activity in the nucleus through binding to transcription factors, Suppressor of Hairless (SU[H], RBP-j&#x003ba; in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Indeed, several groups have reported evidence of the nuclear localization of the intracellular fragments of ligands for Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Recently, it was demonstrated that many single transmembrane-spanning proteins including Notch, Delta and amyloid precursor protein (APP) are substrates for &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the intracellular domains of these substrates are released from the cell membrane by RIP. Common enzymes modulate proteolysis and the turnover of possible signaling molecules has led to the attractive speculation that similar mechanisms widely contribute to proteolysis-regulated signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>Recently, Delwig <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delta proteolysis differs from the conventional RIP, because TM processing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delta is not sensitive to preseniline, and TM and JM cleavages occur independently of each other. Based on these observations, they concluded that Delta proteolysis can act to modulate Delta activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). However, mouse and rat Delta like protein1 (Dll1) are sequentially processed and preseniline is essential for these proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, they adhere more closely to the RIP mechanism. Therefore, it is possible that the intracellular domain of Delta plays a role in bi-directional signaling.</p><p>Indeed, Delta homologs display significant sequence similarity, which is restricted to vertebrates, in their intracellular domain. We show here evidence that the development of neurons from mouse neural stem cells (NSCs) was enhanced by co-culture with Notch1-expressing cells. We further demonstrated that, in developing mouse NSCs, Dll1 is already cleaved and an intracellular domain of Dll1 (Dll1IC) is present in the nucleus. Additionally, Dll1 proteolysis can be upregulated through interaction with Notch1 and this upregulation was strongly inhibited by the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor. We also demonstrated the possibility that Dll1IC mediates transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;)/Activin signaling through binding to Smads, and boosts transcription of specific genes. Finally, we showed that over-expression of Dll1IC in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells induced neurons, and this induction was blocked by SB431542, a specific inhibitor of TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling. These observations strongly suggested that Dll1IC mediates TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling through binding to Smads, and plays an important role in the bi-directional Notch&#x02013;Delta signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Preparation of anti-Dll1IC Antibody</title><p>Dll1IC (nucleotides 1702&#x02013;2166) was cloned into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences, New Jersey).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a, at least four bands were detected on western blots. From the sizes of the bands, band 1 seemed to be the full-length Dll1, while the others appeared to be cleavage products of Dll1.

From the size of band, 90&#x02009;kDa protein seemed to be the full-length Dll1, while the others appeared to be the cleavage products of Dll1. When Dll1 expressing COS7 cells (Dll1/COS7) were co-cultured with COS7 cells carrying vector alone (CTRL/COS7) for 8&#x02009;h, a small amount of cleavage products of Dll1 were initially detected. However, cleavage products of Dll1 were remarkably increased by co-culture with Notch1-expressing COS7 cells (Notch/COS7). For example, even after a 1&#x02009;h incubation, weak bands were detected. Thereafter, amounts of cleaved products increased. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, this enhancement of Dll1processing was strongly inhibited by DAPT which is an inhibitor for &#x003b3;-secretase. </p></sec><sec><title>Dll1IC bound to Smads and enhanced Smad depending transcription</title><p>The nuclear localization of Dll1IC suggests that Dll1IC may have effects on the transcriptions of specific target genes. To examine this possibility, we searched for transcription factors capable of binding to Dll1IC using a new method. Briefly (see Supplementary Figure 2S), nuclear extracts from E11 NSCs were incubated with 150 double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides representing binding sequences of known transcription factors. After immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Dll1IC, double-stranded oligos were eluted from the precipitated complexes and hybridized to arrays that were spotted with the same set of oligos in duplicate. The hybridization signals obtained are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a. The Smad binding sequences (5&#x02032;-AGTATGTCTAGACTGA-3&#x02032;) showed strong signals, which were enhanced by the addition of recombinant Dll1IC to nuclear extracts prior to immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>b). Two spots, signals of which were enhanced by the addition of recombinant Dll1IC protein, were Pax-5 binding sequence and mineral corticoid response element (MRE). The other spots, signals of which were disappeared by the addition of recombinant Dll1IC protein, were NF-&#x003ba;B binding site and NF-E2 binding sequence. </p><p>These findings suggest that Dll1IC forms complexes with Smads in the nucleus of NSCs. Thus, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to confirm these results. FLAG-tagged Smad cDNAs were transfected along with Dll1IC into COS7 cells and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or anti-Dll1IC antibody followed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). Eight vertebrate Smads, designated Smad1 to Smad8, have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although Smad1 and Smad5 did not bind to Dll1IC, Smad2 and Smad3 showed strong binding. Co-transfection with caALK5-HA or caALK6-HA, an expression vector for the constitutively active receptor that phosphorylates Smad2, Smad3 and Smad1, Smad 5, Smad 8, respectively did not show any significant effects on binding. Smad4 also showed strong binding to Dll1IC. Smad6, Smad7 and Smad8 showed weak binding to Dll1IC.</p><p>Next, we examined the effects of Dll1IC on Smad-dependent transcription. We performed dual luciferase assay using 9 &#x000d7; CAGA-Luc promoter&#x02013;reporter plasmids that respond specifically to Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). These promoter&#x02013;reporter plasmids were transfected into HepG2 cells with or without Dll1IC expression vector. After transfection, the cells were stimulated with or without TGF-&#x003b2;, and luciferase activities were measured as an indicator of transcriptional activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, only a little activity was detected without TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation, regardless of whether Dll1IC expression vectors were co-transfected. Stimulation of HepG2 cells with TGF-&#x003b2; significantly induced transcriptional activity from this promoter, and expression of Dll1IC further enhanced the transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. For example, co-transfection of 100 and 400&#x02009;ng of Dll1IC expression vectors were associated with a 175 and 250% enhancement of luciferase activity respectively as compared with TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a). </p><p>We established P19 cells stably over-expressing Dll1IC (Dll1IC/P19). P19 cells, which carry the vector alone (pCDNA/P19), were also established and used as control. 9 &#x000d7; CAGA-Luc promoter&#x02013;reporter plasmids were transfected into Dll1IC/P19 or pCDNA/P19. After transfection, cells were stimulated with TGF-&#x003b2; at various concentrations and luciferase activities were measured. No significant difference of luciferase activity was detected between Dll1IC/P19 and control without TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b). However, stimulation of these cells with TGF-&#x003b2; made significant difference of luciferase activity between Dll1IC/P19 and control cells. In brief, stimulation of Dll1IC/P19 with 0.5 and 1&#x02009;ng/ml TGF-&#x003b2; were associated with 180 and 220% enhancement of luciferase activity respectively as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b).</p></sec><sec><title>Over-expression of Dll1IC in embryonic carcinoma P19 cells induced neurons</title><p>Dll1IC may be involved in neuronal differentiation through binding to Smads. To examine this possibility, we employed Dll1IC/P19 as well as pCDNA/P19 as controls.</p><p>It is well known that stimulation with retinoic acid (RA) is essential for the induction of neurons from P19 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>). Thus, Dll1IC/P19 and pCDNA/P19 were cultured as aggregates for 4 days without RA, and then plated onto coverslips where the cells were allowed to differentiate for 3 days. Although pCDNA/P19 retained epithelial cell-like morphology, Dll1IC/P19 cells became round and showed a bipolar morphology with neurite extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). pCDNA/P19 cells were negative for Tuj1, a marker of neurons, while almost all Dll1IC/P19 cells were Tuj1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). These results indicate that over-expression of Dll1IC in P19 cells induced neurons. However, when 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M SB431542, a specific inhibitor of the TGF-&#x003b2; type1 receptor that activates Smad2 and Smad3 by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35 B36 B37">35&#x02013;37</xref>), was added to Dll1IC/P19 cultures, the appearance of neurons was strongly inhibited. For example, Dll1IC/P19 treated with SB431542 retained epithelial cell-like morphology similar to pCDNA/P19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). Although a few cells had long neurites, less than 10% of the cells were positive for Tuj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a). These findings were confirmed by western blotting. As described above, Dll1IC/P19 and pCDNA/P19 were cultured without RA, allowed to differentiate, and lysates were prepared from subcultured, aggregated and re-plated cells, then subjected to western blotting with Tuj1 antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b, expression of Tuj1 protein was induced after differentiation of Dll1IC/P19. Moreover, SB431542 strongly inhibited this induction and there were no changes detected in pCDNA/P19 throughout the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>b). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>As indicated above, the important question is whether signaling events occur not only from ligand-expressing cells to Notch-expressing cells but also vice versa, i.e. in a bi-directional manner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, up to 50% homologies are still recognized within the intracellular domain through the evolution of vertebrates. Thus, it is highly possible that conservation of these amino acid sequences reflect the functional importance of the intracellular domain. Indeed, we show here evidence that Dll1IC plays an important role in a bi-directional signaling pathway. Since the conservation of these sequences is restricted to vertebrate Delta, it seems that these functions, which are discussed below, would be common to vertebrates, but not invertebrates. Invertebrate DeltaIC may have a different function from that in vertebrates.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, when NSCs were co-cultured on a monolayer of Dll1-expressing COS7 cells, the rate of emergence of neurons was lower than that in controls. It is well known that Notch signaling helps maintain the undifferentiated state of NSCs and inhibits the determination of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Our findings therefore suggest that Dll1 on COS7 cells generates signals to neighboring NSCs that express Notch and thus activates Notch signaling. Conversely, when NSCs were co-cultured on a monolayer of mouse Notch1-expressing COS7 cells for 2 days, the rate of neurons developing from NSCs (55%) was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) higher than that in control cultures (33%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>a and b). These observations indicate that Notch1 on COS7 cells may also generate signals to neighboring NSCs and these ligands, probably Delta, may then transmit signals into the cells expressing them to mediate neuronal differentiation. Thus, signaling events may occur not only from Delta-expressing cells to Notch-expressing cells but also vice versa, that is, in a bi-directional manner, during differentiation of NSCs. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> mosaic experiment supports this idea. Baker and Schubiger published some data from a mosaic experiment in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, showing that expression of Notch in the mesoderm of Notch mutant could suppress the ectodermal defects of the mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This effect was inferred to be due to the extracellular domain of the protein and not its signaling function, since activated Notch failed to produce non-autonomous suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). This suggested that the extracellular domain of Notch expressed in mesoderm was acting as a positive signal to the overlaying ectoderm in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>It has been reported that Delta is cleaved sequentially by proteases, including ADAM and &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>) and processing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delta was up-regulated in co-cultures with Notch-expressing S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). It has also been reported that a truncated intracellular isoform of Delta shows prominent nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, we examined whether the same events occurred in mouse NSCs. Indeed, in developing NSCs, a large proportion of endogenous Dll1 is already cleaved and Dll1IC was localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a). Immunoreactivity against Dll1IC was accumulated in the nucleus and inhibitor of &#x003b3;-secretase strongly blocked this accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>b). Moreover, co-culture experiment showed that Dll1 processing could be enhanced through interaction with Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This enhancement was strongly inhibited by &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Although, as indicated in the introduction, Delwig <italic>et al</italic>. reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Delta proteolysis differs from the conventional RIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), mouse and rat Dll1 adhere more closely to RIP mechanism. Because, mouse and rat Dll1 are sequentially processed and preseniline is essential for these proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, these observations further support the idea that signaling event also occurred from Notch-expressing cells to Delta-expressing cells.</p><p>The nuclear localization of Dll1IC suggests that Dll1IC may have effects on the transcriptions of specific target genes. To examine this possibility, we searched for transcriptional factors capable of binding to Dll1IC using a new method (see Supplementary Figure 2S). Since Smad binding sequence showed a strong signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>a and b), co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to confirm these findings. Smads have been shown to act as mediators of signaling by the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily. Eight vertebrate Smads, designated Smad1 to Smad8, have been identified to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by TGF-&#x003b2; and activin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>), while Smad1 and Smad5 are major components that are activated by bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40 B41 B42">40&#x02013;42</xref>). Although Smad1 and Smad5 did not bind to Dll1IC, Smad2 and Smad3 showed strong binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). These findings suggest that Dll1IC mediates TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling through binding to Smad2 and/or Smad3. Phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 was not required for binding to Dll1IC, as co-transfection with caALK5-HA, an expression vector for the constitutively active receptor that phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, did not show any significant effects on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). However, BMP signaling, which is known to inhibit neurogenesis and to enhance the appearance of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), may not be affected by Dll1IC, as Dll1IC did not bind to Smad1 or Smad5. Although Smad8 is thought to be involved in BMP signaling, it showed only weak binding to Dll1IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). The common Smad, Smad4, which ubiquitously forms heterotrimeric complexes with two other Smads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), also showed strong binding to Dll1IC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>c). Thus, binding of Dll1IC to not only Smad2 and Smad3 but also to Smad4 may stabilize Dll1IC&#x02013;Smad complexes. Smad6 and Smad7 are thought to be inhibitory Smads. Smad7 inhibits both TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling and BMP signaling, whereas Smad6 preferentially inhibits BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Although interactions between Dll1IC and these inhibitory Smads were weak, it is interesting if these interaction can inhibit BMP signaling, which is known to inhibit neurogenesis and to enhance the appearance of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>Although we have yet to determine the actual target genes for the Dll1IC complex with Smad2 or Smad3, we performed dual luciferase assay using 9 &#x000d7; CAGA-Luc promoter&#x02013;reporter plasmids that respond specifically to Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) as a model system. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>a, stimulation of HepG2 cells with TGF-&#x003b2; significantly induced transcriptional activity from this promoter and expression of Dll1IC further enhanced the activity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings strongly suggest that Dll1IC mediates transcription of certain genes, which are targets of TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling, through binding to Smads. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>b, similar transfection experiments using P19 cells stably over-expressing Dll1IC (Dll1IC/P19) also showed that Dll1IC enhanced transcriptional activity and support this conclusion. Interestingly, Pfister <italic>et al</italic>. identified the PDZ protein, Acvrinp1 as a binding protein to mouse Dll1IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Acvrinp1 also interacts with Activin Type II receptors and Smad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Thus, it is likely that Dll1IC can already join in assembling signaling molecules at a subcellular site, then translocate to the nucleus with Smads.</p><p>Dll1IC may be involved in neuronal differentiation through binding to Smads. To examine this possibility, we employed Dll1IC/p19 again. Although P19 cells have been shown to be induced to differentiate into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>), RA stimulation is essential for the induction of neurons from P19 cells. However, neurons could be induced from P19 cells stably over-expressing Dll1IC without RA stimulation and this induction was strongly inhibited by SB431542, a specific inhibitor of TGF-&#x003b2; type1 receptor that activates Smad2 and Smad3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>a and b). Expressions of TGF-&#x003b2;s and their receptors were detected through the differentiation of P19 cells (Supplementary Figure 3S). These results indicate that over-expression of Dll1IC in P19 cells induced neurons through binding to Smad2 and/or Smad3, suggesting that Dll1IC plays an important role in neuronal differentiation. Recently, it has been reported that TGF-&#x003b2; inhibits proliferation and accelerates differentiation of hippocampal granule neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This observation also supports our hypothesis.</p><p>These observations lead us to conclude (see schematic model in Supplementary Figure 4S) that the Notch receptor also supplies signals to Delta that are expressed on the surface of neighboring NSCs. Delta is then cleaved sequentially by proteases, probably including ADAM and &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>), and finally Dll1IC is released from the cell membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it mediates TGF-&#x003b2;/Activin signaling through binding to Smads and enhances transcription of specific genes leading to neuronal differentiation. This conclusion strongly implies the existence of Delta signaling, which means that the Notch-Delta signaling pathway is bi-directional. It is well known that the intracellular domain of Notch is also released from the cell membrane by the RIP mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) similar to those involved in the cleaving of Delta and translocates to the nucleus to modulate gene expression through binding to the transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless (SU[H], RBP-j&#x003ba; in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Therefore, similar mechanisms are involved in both directions of the Notch&#x02013;Delta signaling pathway.</p><p>In the view of a bidirectional signaling pathway, it would be interesting to see if Delta pathway antagonizes Notch pathway. As a pilot experiment, we have examined if Dll1IC is able to regulate the Notch target genes by luciferase assay. However, we could not detect any antagonized or agonized activity of Dll1IC against expression of Hes1 or Hes5 genes as shown in Supplementary Figure 5S.</p><p>BMPs, another group belonging to the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily, have recently been shown to inhibit neurogenesis and to enhance the generation of astrocytes from NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). It is thus likely that the TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily mediates both neurogenesis and gliogenesis from neural stem cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>A total of 150 biotinylated double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides representing known transcription factor binding sequences and arrays that were spotted with the same set of oligo DNAs were generously supplied by B-Bridge International Inc.
