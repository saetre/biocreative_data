ClC-type transporters usually mediate secondary active anion&#x02013;proton exchange. However, under certain conditions they assume slippage mode behavior in which proton and anion transport are uncoupled, resulting in passive anion fluxes without associated proton movements. Here, we use patch clamp and intracellular pH recordings on transfected mammalian cells to characterize exchanger and slippage modes of human ClC-4, a member of the ClC transporter branch. We found that the two transport modes differ in transport mechanisms and transport rates. Nonstationary noise analysis revealed a unitary transport rate of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at +150 mV for the slippage mode, indicating that ClC-4 functions as channel in this mode. In the exchanger mode, unitary transport rates were 10-fold lower. Both ClC-4 transport modes exhibit voltage-dependent gating, indicating that there are active and non-active states for the exchanger as well as for the slippage mode. ClC-4 can assume both transport modes under all tested conditions, with exchanger/channel ratios determined by the external anion. We propose that binding of transported anions to non-active states causes transition from slippage into exchanger mode. Binding and unbinding of anions is very rapid, and slower transitions of liganded and non-liganded states into active conformations result in a stable distribution between the two transport modes. The proposed mechanism results in anion-dependent conversion of ClC-type exchanger into an anion channel with typical attributes of ClC anion channels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Channels and carriers transport ions across the membrane using distinct transport mechanisms. Whereas channels mediate passive diffusion through aqueous pores, coupled transport by carriers is believed to occur by an aqueous conduction pathway with two gates that never open simultaneously, but allow alternating access to the external and the internal medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>). Members of a large family of anion transport proteins, the ClC family, were generally assumed to function as anion channels until reconstituted ClC-ec1 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was shown to mediate secondary-active coupled antiport of anions and protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>). Subsequently, mammalian and plant ClC isoforms were also recognized to function as transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scheel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Angeli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2008</xref>). The existence of different functional subclasses within the ClC family demonstrated the similarity of transporters and channels in this class of proteins and raised the question as to the molecular determinants that define ClC channels or transporters.</p><p>In the presence of certain anions, ClC exchangers assume a so-called slippage mode; i.e., they mediate a passive anion transport without thermodynamically coupled proton flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>). At present, little is known about the function of ClC exchangers in the slippage mode. The slippage mode might be characterized by passive anion diffusion through aqueous pores in a channel-mediated fashion, or it could involve larger conformational changes following a uniporter function.</p><p>Here, we examined slippage mode behavior of a member of the ClC transporter branch, human ClC-4. ClC-4 is localized in intracellular membranes of the brain, muscle, and liver. When heterologously expressed in mammalian cells, ClC-4 also inserts into the surface membrane, allowing separate measurement of anion and proton transport by simultaneous patch clamp and intracellular pH recordings. Using anion exchange experiments and noise analysis, we demonstrate that ClC-4 can switch from coupled to an uncoupled slippage mode of operation that has all the properties of channel-like anion conduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HEK293 cell lines stably expressing ClC-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hebeisen et al., 2003</xref>) were cultured in standard MEM medium, supplemented with 10% FBS and 900 &#x000b5;g/ml geneticin (G418; Invitrogen). Two different oligoclonal cell lines with indistinguishable functional characteristics of hClC-4 were used. Endogenous anion currents in nontransfected HEK293 cells were much smaller than those in stably transfected cells (in external SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> at +145 mV: untransfected cells: 0.59 &#x000b1; 0.05 nA; <italic>n</italic> = 10; transfected cells: 7.0 &#x000b1; 0.6 nA; <italic>n</italic> = 26).

Capacitive cancellation and series resistance compensation were applied to reduce capacitive artifacts and series resistance errors, resulting in voltage errors &#x0003c;5 mV. Currents were digitized with 10&#x02013;100-kHz sampling rates after analogue filtering with less than one third of the sampling frequency. Junction potentials were corrected a posteriori using the JPCalc software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barry, 1994</xref>). The composition of the standard solutions was (in mM): 140 extracellular NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.0, and 105 intracellular NaCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 5 EGTA, and 1 HEPES, pH 7.0. For experiments not including fluorescence pH detection, HEPES concentration in the pipette solution was increased to 10 mM (and NaCl concentration reduced to 96 mM to preserve osmolarity). In some of the experiments, external and/or internal Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was substituted partially with SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, I<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, F<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, or gluconate on an equimolar basis.

The pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF; Invitrogen) was loaded at a concentration of 150 &#x000b5;M through the pipette. The loading procedure was monitored by measuring the time course of fluorescence intensity increase after establishing the whole cell mode. Electrophysiological recordings were not started before complete equilibration between pipette and cytoplasm (3&#x02013;5 min). The dye was excited sequentially at 440 and 490 nm using a Polychrome V fast-switching monochromator, and emitted fluorescence light was detected at 530 nm using a PMT-equipped ViewFinder III (Till Photonics). Fluorescence excitation and detection were software controlled by the photometry extension of PatchMaster. F490/F440 ratios were calculated and converted into absolute pHs after a background fluorescence correction. BCECF had equal pH response when dissolved in the pipette solution or in intact HEK cells loaded with the AM ester (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810155/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>).

For calculating cell volume, the longest and the shortest two-dimensional geometrical measure of each cell were measured using video microscopy. Buffering capacity was measured individually in each cell at the end of the experiments using the ammonium jump technique by applying and washing out solutions containing 30 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (Fig. S1 B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roos and Boron, 1981</xref>).</p><p>At the end of each experiment, cells were clamped at 0 mV, and the time course of intracellular pH recovery was determined (Fig. S1 C).

If large conformational changes of the protein were associated with SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport, the transport rate should saturate at a certain value and not further increase, even at augmented electrochemical gradients upon further depolarization. In contrast, larger transport rates are possible when anions diffuse through aqueous pores. Upon ramp-like protocols with voltages that increase linearly with time, whole cell ClC-4 currents did not saturate up to +400 mV. Current amplitudes at +300 and +400 mV increased to values that are 8 and 17 times larger than the current amplitude at +150 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>).

The time course of pH changes therefore depends on the length of the activating pulses and on the frequency of pulsing. Moreover, effects will be different for transporters that switch between active and not-active forms (gated transporters) than for not-gated transporters. If the number of proton-transporting ClC-4 proteins changes with time and voltage (gated transport), proton currents will activate during voltage steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). In this case, increasing the length of the depolarizing step (T<sub>p</sub>) (see top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>) will augment the number of active transporters and thus the rates of intracellular alkalinization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jgp.org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810155/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>).

To reduce possible artifacts, we measured cell-buffering capacities individually in every cell and shortened test pulses to avoid large perturbations of cytosolic pH. In addition, we measured and corrected for the pH recovery due to buffer diffusion through the pipette in every cell.</p><p>Because the accessibility of closed intracellular compartments for protons is not exactly known, the effective cell volume cannot be accurately determined. This error will lead to an overestimation of effective cell volumes and proton transport rates. For example, if the freely accessible cytosolic volume represented half of the total cell volume, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling ratio for Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> would be 4:1 instead of 2:1, and unitary proton transport rates in the coupled mode would be only 10<sup>4</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at +150 mV. However, this uncertainty does not affect the major conclusion of our paper. An overestimation of the effective cell volume would imply that slippage mode transport rates exceed exchanger transport rates even more than ten-fold, in clear support of distinct underlying transport mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of noise analysis data</title><p>Two earlier studies used nonstationary noise analysis to determine unitary transport rates of ClC-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hebeisen et al., 2003</xref>) and ClC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hebeisen et al. (2003)</xref> treated ClC-4 as pure anion channel and obtained unitary current amplitude of 100 fA at +140 mV, slightly above the values reported here for a different anion composition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al. (2008)</xref> interpreted noise analysis results on a related isoform, ClC-5, in a completely different way. They assumed that ClC-5 exclusively functions as a transporter and thus generates shot noise. Voltage-dependent gating of transporters and low-pass filtering were proposed to transform shot noise into a Lorentzian type of noise. The use of nonstationary noise analysis let the authors assign unitary transport rates of 10<sup>5</sup> ions/s to coupled exchange by ClC-5.</p><p>ClC-4 and ClC-5 are closely similar in primary structure and exhibit the same time and voltage dependence of current amplitudes, indicating that the difference between our results and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al. (2008)</xref> is not due to isoform-specific functional properties. We disagree with the interpretation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al. (2008)</xref> for the following reasons. ClC-4&#x02013;associated noise largely exceeds the upper limit of shot noise generated by a coupled transporter functioning in a 2:1 stoichiometry given by Schottky's theorem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeFelice, 1981</xref>). Our experiments with mixtures of SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) show that ClC-4 can exist in two modes with different transport rates. Because the variance increases with the square of the current amplitude, even small percentage of slippage mode/channels will significantly contribute to the measured current and variance in external Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and render inaccurate the determination of unitary coupled transport rates by noise analysis. The determined unitary turnover rate of 10<sup>5</sup> ions/s at 100 mV in the exchanger mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>) exceeds the maximum transport rates of all currently known coupled transporters. It is one order of magnitude higher than our upper limit of unitary transport rates in the exchanger mode (&#x0223c;10<sup>4</sup> at + 100 mV, extrapolated). In addition, it is also two orders of magnitude higher than values obtained from bacterial ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walden et al., 2007</xref>) and even one order of magnitude higher than the channel mode conductance observed in mutated ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The slippage mode of ClC-4 resembles ion channel function</title><p>Slippage modes of coupled transporters are characterized by passive transport of only one substrate without coupling to the transport of other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nelson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeFelice and Goswami, 2007</xref>). Slippage mode has been demonstrated for a variety of transporters; however, the underlying transport mechanisms remained undefined for the majority of these examples. Here, we demonstrate that ClC-4 generates a Lorentzian type of noise under conditions that promote the uncoupled slippage mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating random switching of unitary current events with amplitudes above the resolution limit. A comparison with simulated data revealed that ClC-4 unitary events have durations between 100 and 200 &#x000b5;s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), largely exceeding values expected for an alternating access mechanism. Moreover, unitary transport rates of ClC-4 in external SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> exceed the highest transport rates reported for ion transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brahm, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hille, 2001</xref>). These results define the slippage mode of ClC-4 as a channel type of conduction.</p><p>The distribution between ClC-4 being in the exchanger or in the slippage mode depends on the extracellular anion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). A comparison of the effects of different anions on total currents and proton fluxes revealed a correlation between ionic radius, anion/proton transport stoichiometries, and concentration dependences of current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Assuming that apparent Michaelis constants report the time the anion dwells at a particular position of the ClC-4 pore, these results suggest that a bound anion is required for ClC-4 being in the exchanger mode. Different anions are expected to occupy this site with distinct probabilities depending on their ionic radius. Anions that bind only shortly promote slippage mode behavior with all properties of classical ion channels.</p><p>This hypothesis is in agreement with various earlier findings on the bacterial transporter, ClC-ec1. In ClC-ec1, anion and proton transport are strictly coupled in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> but uncoupled in larger and polyatomic anions. Crystallographic analysis of ClC-ec1 in SeCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, an anion with chemical properties similar to SCN<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, revealed that a central binding site of ClC-ec1 is depleted of anion density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>). Moreover, a crystallographic study investigating the ion-binding properties of the selectivity filter of ClC-ec1 revealed a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> over Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> binding selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobet and Dutzler, 2005</xref>). Lastly, apparent Michaelis constants measured here for Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> are in a good agreement with the binding affinities obtained from calculating binding site occupancies in ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lobet and Dutzler, 2005</xref>).</p><p>One might expect that a dramatic change in transport mechanism requires pronounced structural rearrangements. This is clearly not the case for ClC-ec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>). Various experimental results support a structural similarity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ClC-s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Estevez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engh and Maduke, 2005</xref>), suggesting that the change in function of ClC-4 reported here also occurs without major changes in structure.</p></sec><sec><title>ClC-4 is a functional intermediate between ClC channels and transporters</title><p>The prototypic ClC transporter ClC-ec1 mediates Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport with transport rates of &#x0223c;4,000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 0 mV and a 100-fold anion transmembrane concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walden et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, mammalian ClC anion channels can conduct anions with transport rates above 10<sup>6</sup> or 10<sup>7</sup> s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pusch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weinreich and Jentsch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scholl et al., 2006</xref>). Our results place ClC-4 between these two functional extremes. In the exchanger mode, transport rates are higher than those of the bacterial ClC isoform, whereas unitary current amplitudes of ClC-4 exceed 1 pA at high voltages in the slippage mode, exceeding single-channel amplitudes of some ClC channels.</p><p>Ion channel gating is crucial for many physiological processes. For transporters, time- and voltage-dependent transitions from active to non-active states were only demonstrated for transporter-associated channels or transporters functioning in the slippage mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melzer et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2005</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that ClC-4 is not only gated by voltage in the slippage mode, but also when functioning in the exchanger mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). Voltage-dependent activation of ClC-4 occurs at voltages positive to 0 mV, and it appears unlikely that changes of endosomal membrane potential will result in full activation of ClC-4 transporters or ClC-4 channels. However, the voltage dependence of relative open probabilities is very shallow (Fig. S3), and thus even small changes in voltage dependence can affect the open probability. Moreover, gating of ClC channels is known to depend on pH and the concentrations of permeant anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Hwang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jentsch, 2008</xref>). Such a modulation is also present in ClC-4 (unpublished data), suggesting a role of voltage-dependent gating in the regulation of endosomal pH by cytoplasmic and intra-endosomal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Implication for ClC channel/transporter function</title><p>Our results demonstrate that ClC-4 can assume slippage modes with all properties that were previously thought to be unique properties of ion channels, i.e., high unitary transport rates and voltage-dependent gating. ClC-type anion exchanger can thus function with properties closely similar to ClC channels. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lisal and Maduke (2008)</xref> demonstrated that voltage-dependent gating of a ClC channel from <italic>Torpedo marmorata</italic>, ClC-0, involves the transmembrane movement of protons, suggesting that ClC channels are broken exchangers with conformational states that are leaky for anions. Both results blur the distinction between channels and transporters even further than previously suggested. ClC exchangers exhibit channel properties, and ClC channels transporter-like features. It is tempting to speculate that ClC channels and antiporters might use the same mechanisms of anion transport. Whereas ClC channels exclusively function in the slippage mode, transporters are also capable to mediate thermodynamically coupled exchange.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lisal and Maduke (2008)</xref> identified one particular step, i.e., the transport of H<sup>+</sup> from the internal to the external membrane site as necessary for voltage-dependent gating in ClC-0. Assuming that similar conformational changes trigger the gating of ClC-0 and ClC-4, our finding that ClC-4 exhibits voltage-dependent gating in its exchanger as well as in its channel mode suggests that anion-dependent uncoupling does not affect partial reaction steps underlying H<sup>+</sup> transport.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological impact</title><p>In endosomes, ClC-3 to ClC-7 are believed to act in conjunction with primary active proton transporters to ensure electrical neutrality of proton movement into cell compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gunther et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iyer et al., 2002</xref>). Such function can be fulfilled by anion channels as well as by anion&#x02013;proton exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faundez and Hartzell, 2004</xref>). With Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> as a main permeant anion, ClC transporters appear to function exclusively as coupled exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Graves et al., 2008</xref>). However, anions that were shown to uncouple ClC-type transporters are present in the human body. Because of the different turnover rates of exchanger and slippage modes, even low concentrations of these anions might have significant effects on anion current amplitudes. 1% of the total number of transporters in the slippage mode will result in 10% anion transport uncoupled to proton movements. ClC-5 was recently demonstrated to actively participate in the control of iodide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van den Hove et al., 2006</xref>). Variations in iodide concentrations will lead to variable ClC-5 transport coupling and modulate iodide uptake. Similar mechanisms may be involved in the metabolism of nitrate and nitrite, anions with emerging physiological importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lundberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Anion channels and coupled Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters have different equilibrium potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>). These thermodynamic differences can result in inward anion currents mediated by ClC exchangers and outward anion currents mediated by ClC channels under certain conditions. Depending on its transport mode, a fraction of ClC-4 will thus exert different effects on endosomal acidification than the remaining ones. Here, we demonstrated that extracellular and correspondingly intra-endosomal anions affect the relative number of ClC-4 exchangers and channels. Other physiological factors, such as pH, or yet to be defined regulatory pathways and accessory subunits might have similar effects and regulate endosomal pH by modulating the transport mode of ClC exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekov and Fahlke, 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810155_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200810155_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Drs.
