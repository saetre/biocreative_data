Using a yeast two-hybrid screen with galectin-1 as bait, Gemin4 was identified as a putative interacting protein. Gemin4 is one component of a macromolecular complex containing approximately 15 polypeptides, including SMN (survival of motor neuron) protein. Rabbit anti-galectin-1 co-immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell nuclear extracts, along with galectin-1, polypeptides identified to be in this complex: SMN, Gemin2 and the Sm polypeptides of snRNPs. Direct interaction between Gemin4 and&#x000a0;galectin-1 was demonstrated in glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. We also found that galectin-3 interacted with Gemin4 and that it constituted one component of the complex co-immunoprecipitated with galectin-1. Indeed, fragments of either Gemin4 or galectin-3 exhibited a dominant negative effect when added to a cell-free splicing assay. For example, a dose-dependent inhibition of splicing was observed in the presence of exogenously added N-terminal domain of galectin-3 polypeptide. In contrast, parallel addition of either the intact galectin-3 polypeptide or the C-terminal domain failed to yield the same effect. Using native gel electrophoresis to detect complexes formed by the splicing extract, we found that with addition of the N-terminal domain the predominant portion of the radiolabeled pre-mRNA was arrested at a position corresponding to the H-complex. Inasmuch as SMN-containing complexes have been implicated in the delivery of snRNPs to the H-complex, these results provide strong evidence that galectin-1 and galectin-3, by interacting with Gemin4, play a role in spliceosome assembly <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential post-transcriptional process coordinated by a macromolecular complex termed the spliceosome. This assembly is composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs) and non-snRNP proteins, estimated to number between 50 and 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c3">3</xref>). Many of these splicing factors are involved in one or more of the following steps: snRNP biogenesis, spliceosome assembly and disassembly and the catalytic events responsible for intron excision and exon ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c6">6</xref>).</p><p> Galectins-1 and -3 belong to a family of proteins defined by their binding to galactose-containing glycoconjugates (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c7">7</xref>). The nuclear localization of galectin-3, coupled with its co-sedimentation with nuclear RNPs and snRNPs, provided the initial hint that it might play a role in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c9">9</xref>). Using a cell-free splicing assay, subsequent experiments documented: (i) saccharides that bind galectins with high affinity inhibited the splicing reaction; (ii)&#x000a0;depletion of both galectins from the nuclear extract, either by lactose affinity chromatography or by antibody adsorption, resulted in concomitant loss of splicing activity; and (iii) either recombinant galectin-1 or recombinant galectin-3 was able to reconstitute splicing activity in a galectin-depleted extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c11">11</xref>). Finally, double immunofluorescence experiments showed that both galectin-1 and -3 can be co-localized in nuclear speckles with known splicing factors (the core polypeptides of snRNPs bearing the Sm epitope and the non-snRNP splicing factor SC35) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c12">12</xref>).</p><p> In order to define the role played by galectins in the splicing process, it was important to identify and characterize their interacting partner(s) in the nucleus. To this end, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using galectin-1 as bait. In the present communication we identify Gemin4, one component of nuclear complexes containing survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein, as a partner that directly binds to galectin-1 and galectin-3. We also show that fragments of either of the Gemin4&#x02013;galectin-3 partners, such as the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Gemin4 &#x0005b;hereafter designated Gemin4(C50)&#x0005d; or the &#x0223c;140-residue N-terminal domain of galectin-3 (designated ND), exert a dominant negative effect on pre-mRNA splicing. The data suggest that the ND blocks an early step in spliceosome formation, consistent with the notion that SMN-containing complexes are responsible for the delivery of snRNPs to the spliceosome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screen</title><p>The cDNA of human galectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c13">13</xref>) was kindly provided by Drs K.Kasai and J.Hirabayashi (Teikyo University, Sagamiko, Kanagawa, Japan). It was subcloned into the <italic>Bam</italic>HI site of the vector pAS2-1 (Clontech) downstream of the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain. A HeLa cell cDNA library fused to pGAD-GH vector was purchased from Clontech and served as the prey. The screen for putative interacting partners was performed following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;LacZ<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones were isolated and their DNAs were amplified by PCR. Sequence analysis was carried out by the Macromolecular Structure, Sequencing and Synthesis Facility at Michigan State University.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein preparations and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays</title><p>Procedures for the preparation of recombinant murine galectin-3 and its ND and CD (C-terminal domain, 147 amino acids) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c14">14</xref>). The purity of these protein preparations was characterized by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and immunoblotting using domain-specific antibodies. In addition, the molecular weights of recombinant galectin-3, ND and CD were determined by mass spectrometry, using matrix-assisted laser desorption&#x0002f;ionization (Voyager-DE STR; PE PerSeptive Biosystems). The same samples were also subjected to amino acid sequence analysis, using a Procise pulsed liquid protein sequence (PE Applied Biosystems). Both of these procedures, carried out by the Macromolecular Structure, Sequencing and Synthesis Facility at Michigan State University, confirmed the identity and purity of the protein preparations. Bovine galectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c15">15</xref>) used for the <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay was kindly provided by Dr&#x000a0;Ten Feizi (Imperial College School of Medicine, Northwick Park, Harrow, UK).</p><p> The cDNA of Gemin4(C50), identified through the yeast two-hybrid screen, was subcloned into the <italic>Nco</italic>I and <italic>Eco</italic>RI restriction sites of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) to produce the fusion protein GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50).

Approximately 1 &#x000b5;g of GST or GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) was adsorbed to 20 &#x000b5;l of the pretreated beads. Then, 0.5 &#x000b5;g of bovine galectin-1 or recombinant murine galectin-3 was incubated with the GST or GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) beads at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 h in 60&#x00025; buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20&#x00025; glycerol, 100 mM KCl and 0.2 mM EDTA) containing 0.05&#x00025; Triton X-100.

We screened 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> independent clones and isolated 12&#x000a0;His<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;LacZ<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> clones. Based on sequence analysis, four clones were identified as ribosomal proteins (RPL37, RPS26, RPS3 and 60S acidic ribosomal protein PO), four clones were identified as cytochrome oxidase subunit III and two clones were identified as ubiquitin-like proteins, human SMT3B&#x0002f;SUMO-3 (<underline>s</underline>mall <underline>u</underline>biquitin-like <underline>mo</underline>difier). Two clones contained novel sequences at the time of initial isolation. One of the latter, however, was identified as the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Gemin4 (accession no. AF173856) when the sequence was subjected to a BLAST search against the GenBank sequence database. There was 100&#x00025; identity between the two sequences (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f1">1</xref>). The sequence identified through the yeast two-hybrid screen is designated Gemin4(C50).</p><p> The cDNA of Gemin4(C50) was subcloned into pGEX-2T and the fusion protein GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) was purified from the bacterial expression system. Direct binding between galectin-1 and Gemin4(C50) was tested in GST pull-down assays. Galectin-1 bound to GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>A, lane 3) but not to GST alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>A, lane 2). We also tested the binding of galectin-3 to Gemin4(C50) using the same <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay. Galectin-3 bound directly to GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>B, lane 6) but not to GST (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>B, lane 5).</p><p> In these experiments galectin-1 and galectin-3 were visualized by immunoblotting. The membranes used for immunoblotting were also stained with Coomassie blue to reveal GST (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> &#x0223c;27 000) and GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) (<italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> &#x0223c;32 000). This was done as a control to ascertain that approximately the same amounts of GST and GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) were adsorbed onto the glutathione beads (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>C, lanes 7 and 8). Finally, we also tested and found no binding of bovine serum albumin to the GST and GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) beads (data not shown). Thus, it can be inferred that galectin-1, as well as galectin-3, interacts specifically with Gemin4.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-immunoprecipitation of galectin-1 and galectin-3 in complexes containing SMN</title><p>Gemin4 is one of approximately 15 polypeptides of a macromolecular complex containing SMN, Gemin2, Gemin3 and the core polypeptides of snRNPs bearing the Sm epitope (Sm B&#x0002f;B&#x02032;, Sm D1&#x02013;D3 and Sm E&#x02013;G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c26">26</xref>). Thus, our demonstration of a direct interaction between galectin-1 and Gemin4 prompted us to test whether galectin-1 is also a component of such nuclear complexes containing SMN. Polyclonal rabbit anti-galectin-1 was used to immunoprecipitate complexes from NE derived from HeLa cells. Proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-galectin-1 were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with various antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f3">3</xref>). First, anti-galectin-1 immunoprecipitated galectin-1 from NE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f3">3</xref>, top). In addition, the following polypeptides, for which we had antibody reagents, were also found in the same anti-galectin-1 immunoprecipitate: (i) SMN (&#x0223c;38 kDa); (ii) Gemin2 (&#x0223c;36 kDa); (iii) galectin-3 (&#x0223c;30 kDa); and (iv) the Sm B, B&#x02032; and D polypeptides of the snRNPs.</p><p> Control experiments using preimmune serum did not precipitate any of the proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f3">3</xref>, labeled PI). Moreover, we also tested and found that irrelevant nuclear proteins, such as high mobility group (HMG) 14&#x0002f;17, were not detectable in the anti-galectin-1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f3">3</xref>, bottom). These results suggest that the polypeptides identified above represented bona fide components of macromolecular complexes co-precipitated by anti-galectin-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of addition of the N-terminal domain of galectin-3 on the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction</title><p>It is interesting to note that galectin-3 is also found in the immunoprecipitate of anti-galectin-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f3">3</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that galectin-3 can interact directly with Gemin4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>B), which may, in turn, incorporate it into the macromolecular complex. The polypeptide of galectin-3 contains two domains: (i) a proline- and glycine-rich ND; and (ii) the carbohydrate-binding CD. We have isolated preparations of ND and CD and have carefully characterized them in terms of purity by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analysis. The availability of these reagents, representing fragments of the intact galectin-3 polypeptide, suggested the opportunity to test their effects in a cell-free splicing assay.</p><p> NE derived from HeLa cells exhibited strong splicing activity in our <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, converting &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the pre-mRNA substrate into the mature mRNA product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lane 1). When the splicing reaction was carried out in the presence of exogenously added ND, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of splicing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8). Inhibition of splicing was noticeable at a concentration as low as 1.2 &#x000b5;M (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lane 6). Complete inhibition was observed at 10 &#x000b5;M ND: there were barely detectable levels of products and splicing intermediates and substantially higher levels of the starting substrate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lane 8).</p><p> The splicing reaction was also carried out in the presence of exogenously added full-length recombinant galectin-3. Over a concentration range of 3&#x02013;12 &#x000b5;M, the intact galectin-3 polypeptide had no effect on the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Similarly, no inhibition was observed when the splicing reaction was carried out in the presence of exogenously added CD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lanes 9&#x02013;12). The concentration of CD tested ranged from 3 to 57 &#x000b5;M. Thus, the inhibitory effect of ND on the cell-free splicing assay was specific, inasmuch as parallel addition of either full-length galectin-3 or CD failed to yield the same effect.</p><p> Several possibilities were considered to account for the observed inhibition of splicing by ND. For example, the ND preparation could be contaminated by a protease that degraded essential components of the splicing machinery. On the basis of our previous experience showing that depletion of NE with antibodies directed against the Sm antigens of snRNPs resulted in the loss of splicing activity in this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c11">11</xref>), we specifically tested for any effects of ND on the Sm antigens. Incubation of NE with ND, CD or full-length recombinant galectin-3 under the conditions of the splicing assay did not reduce the levels of the B, B&#x02032; and D polypeptides of the Sm antigens (data not shown).</p><p> We also tested for possible RNase activity in our protein preparations. The <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pre-mRNA substrate was incubated with NE in the presence or absence of exogenous ND, CD and recombinant galectin-3. This incubation was carried out in the absence of ATP. (In the presence of ATP such incubation would simply correspond to a splicing assay and the pre-mRNA would be converted to the mature RNA product.) Surprisingly, the inclusion of any of our protein preparations (ND, CD or full-length recombinant galectin-3) resulted in a higher recovery of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pre-mRNA than incubation with NE alone. The basis for this better recovery is not known, but these results are consistent with the results of the splicing assay, in which substantially higher levels of the starting pre-mRNA substrate were found in reactions inhibited by ND (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f4">4</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;8). In any case, the ND preparation did not degrade the pre-mRNA substrate.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of addition of galectin-3 ND on spliceosome formation</title><p>The MINX pre-mRNA substrate forms several complexes, distinguished by the composition of the RNP components, during the course of the splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c22">22</xref>). Initially, the pre-mRNA is complexed with hnRNP proteins to form the H-complex. In the presence of ATP, specific snRNPs become associated with the H-complex to form the A and B active spliceosomal complexes. We have used the gel mobility shift assay to detect complexes formed by the splicing extract in the presence of exogenously added ND, CD or full-length recombinant galectin-3.</p><p> Under our electrophoretic conditions (10.7 cm gel, 150 V, 90&#x000a0;min), <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pre-mRNA, in the absence of any proteins (no NE added), migrated off the bottom of the gel. When NE is added in the absence of ATP, only a radiolabeled smear corresponding to the H-complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 1) can be found, even after 5 min incubation. In the presence of ATP, the H-complex is also observed at 0 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 2); after 5 min incubation, bands corresponding to the higher order active complexes (A and B) become prominent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 3). The summation of complexes A and B accounted for &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of the radioactivity in lane 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>). These higher order complexes are also observed when full-length recombinant galectin-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 4) or CD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 6) is added to the NE, pre-mRNA substrate and ATP for 5 min. In contrast, the addition of ND arrested the predominant portion of the radioactive pre-mRNA at the H-complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>, lane 5). The H-complex accounted for 83&#x00025; of the radioactivity in lane 5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>). Although a small amount of radioactivity (&#x0223c;16&#x00025;) could be found at a position corresponding to the A-complex, no B-complex formation was evident. Finally, there was essentially no difference in the total amount of radioactivity between the samples shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f5">5</xref>.</p><p> It should perhaps be noted that using the electrophoretic conditions described for native gels, the position in the gel indicated as the H-complex region actually consists of two complexes, the H- and E-complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c27">27</xref>). Both are formed in the absence of ATP. H-complexes contain the splicing substrate and hnRNP proteins while E-complexes additionally incorporate U1 snRNP at the 5&#x02032; splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c2">2</xref>). Therefore, our present use of the term H-complex is meant to indicate a region of the gel rather than a distinction between H- and E-complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of addition of GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) on the splicing assay</title><p>Since the ND fragment of galectin-3 exerts a dominant negative effect when added to a splicing reaction, we tested whether a&#x000a0;fragment of Gemin4, the other component of the galectin-3&#x02013;Gemin4 interacting partners, might yield a similar effect. Two lines of evidence indicate that the C-terminal 50 amino acids of Gemin4 possessed sufficient structural information for proper folding and binding to other proteins: (i) galectin-1 interacted with this 50 amino acid fragment to activate the transcriptional reporter in the yeast two-hybrid screen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f1">1</xref>); and (ii) <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assays showed that Gemin4(C50) can bind both galectin-1 and galectin-3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>). Thus, Gemin4(C50) represents a fragment with retention of at least some of the binding properties of the full-length Gemin4 polypeptide.</p><p> The NE used in this experiment converted &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of the pre-mRNA substrate into the mature mRNA product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f6">6</xref>, lane 1). When the splicing reaction was carried out in the presence of GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50), &#x0003c;2&#x00025; conversion into the final product was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f6">6</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). No such inhibition was observed with corresponding concentrations of GST (mature mRNA product accounted for 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; of the radioactive RNA species; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f6">6</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). The purities of the GST and GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) protein preparations were monitored during our GST pull-down studies (see for example Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f2">2</xref>C). Neither preparation appeared to contain non-specific proteases inasmuch as little or no degradation of galectin-1 or galectin-3 was observed in those binding assays. Finally, neither the GST nor the GST&#x02013;Gemin4(C50) protein preparations appeared to degrade the pre-mRNA substrate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The key findings of the present study include: (i) Gemin4 is an interacting partner of galectin-1 as identified through a yeast two-hybrid screen and it binds galectin-1 and galectin-3 directly in GST pull-down assays; (ii) galectin-1 and galectin-3 are associated with macromolecular complexes that also contain polypeptides previously identified with one or more steps of the pre-mRNA splicing process; (iii) fragments of either one of the interacting partners, Gemin4 or galectin-3, exert a dominant negative effect when added exogenously to the cell-free splicing assay; and (iv) inhibition of splicing by the galectin-3 ND appears to be due to a block at the H-complex in assembly of the active spliceosome. The key points of these findings are summarized in the schematic diagram of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f7">7</xref>.</p><p> Three different lines of experiments now converge at the H-complex to implicate it as a site of action of galectins-1 and -3 in the splicing of pre-mRNA. First, we have identified galectin-1 and galectin-3 as novel components of macromolecular complexes containing SMN, Gemin2 and the core snRNP polypeptides bearing the Sm epitope (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f7">7</xref>, left). Both galectins interact directly with at least one component of these complexes, Gemin4. The SMN-containing complexes are found in the cytoplasm and in discrete nuclear bodies called gems (gemini of coiled bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c29">29</xref>). In the former the SMN complex is associated with snRNP core proteins and plays a critical role in the biogenesis of snRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c31">31</xref>). In the nucleus SMN is required for pre-mRNA splicing by supplying snRNPs to the H-complex in the assembly of spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c32">32</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f7">7</xref>, right). This H-complex juncture is indeed where galectins appear to be required, as demonstrated by the effect of galectin depletion and by the effect of galectin-3 ND addition.</p><p> Secondly, in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c10">10</xref>) we had documented that NEs depleted of the galectins by affinity adsorption on lactose&#x02013;agarose beads failed to form active spliceosomal complexes and gel mobility shift assays of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled pre-mRNA revealed only bands migrating in the H-complex region. Moreover, the activities of the galectin-depleted extract, in forming splicing complexes and in performing the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction, were reconstituted by addition of recombinant galectin-3 with similar dose&#x02013;response curves. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that the galectins may be required at an early stage in the splicing pathway, such as organization of the H-complex for addition of other splicing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c33">33</xref>). Interpreted in the context of our current findings, the effect of galectin depletion is most likely to be exerted at either the assembly of SMN-containing complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f7">7</xref>, left) or docking of such complexes at the H-complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f7">7</xref>, right).</p><p> Finally, when the splicing assay was carried out in the presence of exogenously added ND of galectin-3, we also observed a dose-dependent inhibition of product formation. Again, this inhibition was associated with the arrest of spliceosome assembly at the H-complex. In both the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction and in assembly of active spliceosomes parallel additions of either the full-length galectin-3 polypeptide or the CD failed to yield the same effect.</p><p> Recently, the ND of galectin-3 has been expressed as a polypeptide fused to GST. Addition of this GST&#x02013;ND fusion protein to our splicing assay also resulted in inhibition of splicing, as did addition of ND. In contrast, GST itself had no effect when added to the same splicing assay (see also Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke484f6">6</xref>). Thus, two preparations of the galectin-3 ND, expressed in distinct systems and purified by different procedures, both inhibited the splicing reaction.</p><p> Physico-chemical studies have been carried out on the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c14">14</xref>) and hamster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c34">34</xref>) homologs of galectin-3, as well as isolated ND and CD preparations derived from the full-length polypeptide. These studies have indicated that the two domains of galectin-3 are structurally as well as functionally distinct and independent. For example, differential scanning calorimetry of mouse galectin-3 yielded distinct transition temperatures for ND (&#x0223c;40&#x000b0;C) and CD (&#x0223c;55&#x000b0;C), both in the full-length polypeptide and as isolated preparations of individual domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c14">14</xref>). Similarly, the circular dichroic spectrum of intact hamster galectin-3 is reproduced by an appropriately weighted summation of the spectra of the ND and CD fragments, suggesting that the isolated domains retain the structure that they had in the intact molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c34">34</xref>).</p><p> Both of these studies, as well as studies on the human homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c36">36</xref>), clearly show that the CD bears the carbohydrate-binding activity of the protein. In addition, the CD of galectin-3 has been shown to interact with a cytoplasmic cysteine- and histidine-rich protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c37">37</xref>). In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke484c11">11</xref>) we had found that polypeptides corresponding to the CD (the CD of galectin-3 or galectin-1, which contains a single domain homologous to it) were sufficient to reconstitute splicing activity in a galectin-depleted NE. However, the minimum concentrations required for activity were four to eight times higher than that of the full-length galectin-3 polypeptide, which contains the proline- and glycine-rich ND.</p><p> This differential concentration effect on splicing reconstitution by intact galectin-3 versus its CD (or galectin-1) implies that both domains of galectin-3 interact with the splicing machinery. The nature of these interactions is unclear. Regardless of this, the observed splicing inhibition by excess ND likely occurs through perturbation of one set of these interactions and supports this suggestion.</p><p> The identification of Gemin4 as an interacting partner of galectin-1 and galectin-3 represents an important advance in our investigation of the role of galectins in the cell nucleus. First, it provides evidence that galectins-1 and -3 interact with splicing components <italic>in vivo</italic>, as had been inferred previously on the basis of depletion&#x02013;reconstitution and co-localization experiments. The dominant negative effect on splicing exerted by Gemin4(C50) strengthens the notion that direct binding between the galectins and Gemin4 are functionally relevant in the splicing pathway. Secondly, it supports our previous notion that, mechanistically, the locus of galectin action is at the H-complex during assembly of spliceosomes. Finally, it offers new insights on the analysis of the composition and identities of polypeptides in the macromolecular complexes required for the splicing machinery and how galectin-1 or galectin-3 may facilitate this process.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke484f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of Gemin4 and the corresponding sequence of the clone identified as a ligand of galectin-1.
