It is a key process to eliminate damaged cells during aging or following cellular injuries, or extra cells during developmental processes. It is a subject of debate whether such a form of cell death program exists in unicellular organisms, as there is no benefit for a single cell to kill itself. In nature, single cell organisms such as yeasts or bacteria develop in colonies or in biofilms and under those conditions, cells are in contact with each other. Several reports have shown that the death of some cells is of benefit to the rest of the colony and confers growth advantage over their competitors. In yeast colonies, an ammonia signal is emitted upon oxidative stress that triggers yeast death only in the centre of the colony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Vachova1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover this phenomenon is advantageous to younger cells at the periphery as physically removing central dying cells reduces growth at the outer margin of the colony. Also yeast cells containing killer viruses have been reported to induce genetically programmed cell death among non-infected cells in the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Ivanovska1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> allowing survival advantage for viruses containing <italic>versus</italic> non-containing cells in chronologically aged cultures.</p><p>From a molecular point of view there are indications that yeast cells in some circumstances die with biochemical markers of apoptosis. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or acetic acid, yeast cells exhibit DNA strand breakage, chromatin fragmentation and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Madeo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Ludovico2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These molecular changes associated with death require active protein synthesis since they are prevented by cycloheximide, a potent translation inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Madeo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Such apoptotic markers have also been described after exposure to other external stresses such as NaCl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Huh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Wadskog1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, UV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-DelCarratore1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, high levels of the yeast mating pheromone alpha factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Severin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, or even in the absence of external stress, in a mutated <italic>cdc48</italic> context. <italic>CDC48</italic> encodes an ATPase involved in the retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated proteins into the cytosol for processing by the proteasome, and one particular <italic>cdc48</italic> mutant has been shown to die exhibiting typical apoptotic markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Madeo2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Ye1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In yeast, orthologues of key regulators of late mammalian apoptotic events have so far been identified. The yeast protease Yor197wp (Yca1) behaves very much like a mammalian caspase: it is cleaved in the presence of hydrogen peroxide thus gaining caspase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis either being abrogated or increased when <italic>YCA1</italic> is deleted or overexpressed respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Madeo3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, an <underline>A</underline>poptosis <underline>I</underline>nhibiting <underline>F</underline>actor (AIF) homologue in yeast, Ynr074cp, has been reported that translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is able to degrade yeast nuclear DNA and plasmid DNA in a similar manner to mammalian AIF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Wissing1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, yeast Nma111p was found to be homologous to the mammalian mediator of apoptosis HtrA2/Omi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> and the presence of apoptotic markers in dead yeast cells exposed to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is dependent on Nma111p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Fahrenkrog1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite accumulating data showing apoptotic phenotypes in unicellular organisms and the presence of orthologues of some key apoptotic regulators, it is still unclear whether fully integrated cell death pathways exist in yeast. In particular, the early steps of a defined cell death program are unknown, even though the heterologous expression of active forms of proapoptotic mammalian Bax in yeast induces cell death with apoptotic phenotypes, and targets mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Manon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Ligr1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. No Bax orthologue has been found in yeast. Interestingly, it was recently reported that, similarly to the human cohesin Rad21 that is involved in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Pati1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Chen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, the yeast homologue of hRad21, Mcd1, is cleaved by the caspase-like protease Esp1 after exposure to lethal doses of hydrogen peroxide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Yang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Further, the C-terminal part of Mcd1 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria and cell death is enhanced under those conditions.</p><p>In this study we have investigated the role of the yet uncharacterized yeast protein Tah18 that was previously identified in our laboratory through a genetic screen for synthetic mutants with <italic>pol3-13</italic>, a thermosensitive allele of <italic>POL3</italic> which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Chanet1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We first generated thermosensitive <italic>tah18</italic> mutants that proved to be highly resistant to an acute exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We then demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death is dependent on Tah18 abundance in the cell. In the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we observed GFP-Tah18 relocalization to the mitochondria, which was not detectable using fluorescent mutated versions of Tah18. Next, we showed that mitochondria in <italic>tah18</italic> mutants are protected against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced damage, with cytochrome c more degraded in wild-type than in <italic>tah18</italic> cells. <italic>DRE2</italic> was then identified as genetically interacting with <italic>TAH18</italic>, as mutated alleles are synthetic lethal, and Dre2 overexpression can suppress <italic>tah18</italic> growth defects at 35&#x000b0;C. Dre2 was recently characterized as a Fe/S protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Zhang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> whose human homologue, Ciapin1, is an anti-apoptotic protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Shibayama1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Ciapin1 was found to suppress the <italic>&#x00394;dre2</italic> lethality and interact physically with Tah18 in the absence of oxidative stress. Finally, expressing Tah18 and Dre2 as a single fusion protein allowed viability. Moreover, the fusion protein did not delocalize to mitochondria and prevented cell death in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. From this work we conclude that Tah18 plays a &#x0201c;pro-death&#x0201d; role in response to oxidative stress. After exposure to lethal doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Tah18 targets the mitochondria and promotes cell death in yeast and thus is a component of a cell death program although no connexion between Tah18 and cell death had been anticipated. As no Bax/Bcl2 homologues have been described so far in this organism, we discuss the significance of these findings with respect to yeast physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>1.

The N-terminus includes a Flavodoxin-like domain that consists of about 170 residues with a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding site. This domain is involved in electron transfer reactions, and has been found in various species. In the central and C-terminal part of the protein, blast analysis identified potential FAD- and NAD-binding domains also compatible with electron transfer activity.

Surprisingly, this strain was fully viable, suggesting that the dissociation of Dre2 from Tah18 in wild-type cells might not be essential for viability. Immunodetection using an anti-Dre2 antibody in crude extracts indicated that the fusion protein is detected as a single band with an expected size of 110 kDa and behaves like Dre2 in the absence or presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as a small amount of the fusion protein is detected in the mitochondria in both conditions and does not relocalise to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004376-g005">Fig. 5-C lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8, Fig. 5-D lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8</xref>).

In the absence of exogenous oxidative stress, Tah18 and Dre2 physically interact outside the mitochondria. In the presence of oxidative stress, Tah18 is targeted to the mitochondria and controls mitochondrial integrity and cell death. Together, these results argue for the existence of a mitochondria-dependent cell death program in yeast involving Tah18.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Tah18 targets mitochondria and is a pro-death factor in the presence of oxidative stress</title><p>We observed relocalization of the GFP-Tah18 fusion to mitochondria after exposure to high doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> This relocalization is affected in <italic>tah18-5H8</italic> and <italic>tah18-5I5</italic> mutants. Moreover, we show that cytochrome c is rapidly destabilized and degraded in a Tah18-dependent manner under the same conditions. These findings under oxidative stress conditions are partly reminiscent of the properties of Bax in mammalian cells. Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein from the evolutionary conserved Bcl2 family, whose members regulate apoptosis either positively or negatively. Bax is inserted at the outer membrane of mitochondria at the early stage of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Wolter1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Gross1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

Heterologous expression of human Bax in yeast is able to induce efficient mitochondria targeting and cell death only when the Bax conformation is stably changed due to mutations in the coding sequence or in the presence of a C-terminal tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Manon1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Ligr1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. We show here that Tah18 galactose-driven overexpression induces neither Tah18 targeting to mitochondria nor toxicity in yeast in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, Tah18 targeting to the mitochondria is accurately controlled by the redox balance. We artificially targeted GFP-Tah18 to the mitochondrial matrix using a Mitochondrial Localization Sequence (MLS) in the absence of oxidative stress. This strain was found to be viable in the presence of wild-type Tah18 and exhibited a strong mitochondrial GFP fluorescence (not shown), showing that Tah18 is not toxic when located in the mitochondria in the absence of oxidative stress, and suggesting that Tah18 may need to be modified by oxidative stress to relocalize to the mitochondria and be toxic, similarly to Bax.</p><p>From a molecular point of view, the signal that triggers Tah18 relocalization to the mitochondria is unknown and prediction software did not detect any Mitochondrial Localization Sequence in Tah18. Different mechanisms have been described that lead to non-resident protein translocation into the mitochondria after stress. In the case of the human CDK11 p110 isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Feng1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, human Bid (another pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Luo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Gross2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, or yeast Mcd1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Yang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, protein cleavage is responsible for mitochondrial translocation. It is unlikely that Tah18 generates a cleavage product under oxidative stress, as the size of the GFP-Tah18 detected by Western blotting in mitochondrial extracts after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure is that of a full length protein. Translocation to the mitochondria after release from sequestration by a partner has been described for Bax <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004376-Sawada1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. To our knowledge, no such mechanism has been characterized to date with yeast proteins. We identified <italic>DRE2</italic>, which interacts genetically with <italic>TAH18</italic> in the absence of oxidative stress, and showed that gene products physically interact <italic>in vivo</italic>. Forcing the Dre2-Tah18 interaction by expressing them as a fusion results in an increased resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death, and the fusion protein is not relocalized to the mitochondria. Also overexpressing Dre2 in yeast renders the cells more resistant to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> arguing again that promoting the interaction between Tah18 and Dre2 helps prevent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death and that Dre2 might be considered as an &#x0201c;anti-death&#x0201d; factor.
