Here, we demonstrated that the splitting was transient and the exhaustion of GTP resulted in re-association of the split subunits into 70S ribosomes unless IF3 (initiation factor 3) was present. However, the splitting was observed with sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) without IF3 if RRF, EF-G and GTP were present in the SDGC buffer. The splitting of 70S ribosomes causes the decrease of light scattering by ribosomes. Kinetic constants obtained from the light scattering studies are sufficient to account for the splitting of 70S ribosomes by RRF and EF-G/GTP during the lag phase for activation of ribosomes for the log phase. As the amount of 70S ribosomes increased, more RRF, EF-G and GTP were necessary to split 70S ribosomes. In the presence of a physiological amount of polyamines, GTP and factors, even 0.6 &#x003bc;M 70S ribosomes (12 times higher than the 70S ribosomes for routine assay) were split. Spermidine (2 mM) completely inhibited anti-association activity of IF3, and the RRF/EF-G/GTP-dependent splitting of 70S ribosomes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Translation (protein synthesis) from aminoacyl tRNA consists of four consecutive steps: initiation, elongation, termination and recycling of the machinery of the protein synthesis for the next round of translation. Each step is controlled and catalyzed by translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). During the termination step, the stop codon in the ribosomal acceptor site (A-site) is recognized by class-1 release factors (RFs); RF1 or RF2 in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) and eRF1 in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These factors bind to the A-site of the ribosome in response to the termination codon and induce the ribosome to hydrolyze peptidyl-tRNA at the peptidyl-tRNA site (P-site) and then the nascent polypeptide is released from the tRNA on the ribosome. Class-2 release factors RF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and eRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) possess GTPase activity and stimulate the release of class-1 RFs from the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), leaving the post-termination complex. The post-termination complex consists of three components, mRNA with the termination codon at the A-site, tRNA at the P/E-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>) and the 70S ribosome. The next step is the disassembly of the post-termination ribosomal complex. This step in prokaryotes is an active process catalyzed by a protein called the ribosome-recycling factor (RRF) together with elongation factor G (EF-G) and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The disassembly step includes one of the crucial steps of protein synthesis, the splitting of 70S ribosomes into subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Although there are some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18 B19">16&#x02013;19</xref>), the splitting of ribosomes is well accepted as an essential necessary step before the canonical translation initiation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In bacteria, the splitting of the vacant 70S ribosome has been thought to be catalyzed by initiation factor 3 (IF3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and initiation factor 1 (IF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) without involving RRF and EF-G/GTP for a long time. This concept is originated because IF3 alone splits 70S ribosomes to some extent and IF1 assists this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, the splitting of vacant 70S ribosomes by IF3 and IF1 is slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and of lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) than that by RRF and EF-G. Furthermore, splitting of vacant ribosomes by IF3 alone requires a concentration of IF3 much higher than that <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The fact that RRF is involved in splitting of post-termination complex was first suggested by an indirect method of measuring peptide synthesis in a limited amount of subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Only recently, three different laboratories showed RRF-dependent splitting of 70S ribosomes with various direct methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Briefly, Hirokawa <italic>et al.</italic> showed that RRF and EF-G/GTP split vacant 70S ribosomes using the decrease of ribosomal light scattering upon dissociation into subunits. In addition, they showed splitting of post-termination complex directly in sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) in the presence of IF3. On the other hand, Zavialov <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) presented SDGC evidence that the exchange of the 30S subunits of the post-termination complexes with free 30S subunits were dependent on RRF, EF-G and GTP. Furthermore, Peske <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) of fluorescence-labeled subunits to show the splitting of 70S ribosomes by RRF and EF-G/GTP. The FRET method, however, may not be suitable for studying the actual physical splitting of subunits [for more discussion of this matter, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>)]. IF3 prevents reassociation of the split subunits. Recent evidence suggests that IF3 may participate more directly in the disassembly by RRF and EF-G/GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). This view was however recently refuted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>The splitting of 70S ribosomes is not limited to the recycling process. When cells are in the stationary phase, or shift-down conditions, the protein synthesis is lowered or stopped and most of the ribosomes take the form of 100S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) or 70S ribosomes. In this paper, we concentrate mostly on the splitting of the vacant 70S ribosomes.</p><p>Despite the aforementioned evidence for the involvement of the translocation factor in the splitting of ribosomes, Umekage and Ueda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) recently suggested that RRF and EF-G/GTP may not be involved in the splitting of 70S ribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Their evidence was based on the finding that 0.6&#x02013;1.2 &#x000b5;M 70S ribosomes [closer to the natural concentration (20 &#x000b5;M) than the conventional ribosome concentration (0.05 &#x000b5;M) used in our <italic>in vitro</italic> system] could not be split by RRF and EF-G/GTP in their buffer containing 2 mM spermidine. They showed that 70S ribosomes in lower concentrations were split into subunits by RRF and EF-G/GTP in the conventional buffer without spermidine. Although there has been no systematic studies of the effect of polyamines on the ribosome recycling, the polymix buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), containing 1 mM spermidine and 8 mM putrescine (Ptc) could still support the RRF- and EF-G/GTP-dependent splitting of 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>We showed, in this paper, the critical role of GTP for keeping the ribosomal subunits separate and the exhaustion of GTP converted subunits back to 70S ribosomes when IF3 was not present. As soon as IF3 was added, the consumption of GTP energy was not necessary for keeping the subunits separate. The increased 70S ribosome concentration resulted in less subunit dissociation. However, this effect was overcome by increasing GTP and RRF/EF-G concentrations. The <italic>in vitro</italic> velocity of the splitting of the vacant ribosomes was sufficient to account for the conversion of 70S ribosomes into subunits during the lag phase. Furthermore, we showed that 0.6 &#x000b5;M ribosome could be split by physiological concentrations of EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), RRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) in the presence of polyamines present <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), supporting the notion that RRF/EF-G-dependent splitting takes place <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Buffers</title><p>Buffer R: 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4, 8.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 84 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.2 mM DTT (dithiothreitol).

This is in contrast to the conventional translocation reaction where the nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP functioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), though slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). It was therefore of interest to examine what happened to the splitting reaction when GTP was exhausted. For this purpose, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, we estimated the minimal concentration of GTP that was sufficient for the splitting of 70S ribosomes under our experimental conditions.</p><p>Most of the experimental systems we used in this paper, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, were to observe the splitting of vacant ribosomes by EF-G, RRF and GTP in the presence of IF3 followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC) to measure the amount of 70S, 50S and 30S ribosomes. The SDGC was an analysis method and had nothing to do with the splitting reaction. When IF3 was added, the split subunits were prevented from re-associating back to 70S ribosomes and the reaction was completely finished before the reaction mixture was placed on the sucrose gradient for analysis.</p><p>In the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the 70S ribosome preparation was incubated with RRF, EF-G and IF3 with various concentrations of GTP (0&#x02013;250 &#x000b5;M) for 15 min and the sedimentation patterns of ribosomes were analyzed by SDGC. The result showed that more subunits were detected with the increasing concentrations of GTP in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of 50 &#x000b5;M GTP, about 30% of 70S ribosomes were split into their subunits (the percentage of conversion values are indicated below each profile). We concluded that the extent of splitting was dependent on the amount of GTP.</p><p>We then examined the effect of the depletion of GTP during the ribosomal splitting by RRF and EF-G. As shown in the left profile of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, after the 70S ribosome preparation was incubated for 5 min with RRF, EF-G, IF3 and 50 &#x000b5;M GTP, 39% of the total ribosomes were 70S ribosomes. In the ribosome preparation used, 74.8% were 70S ribosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, left profile). We therefore concluded that significant splitting was observed with 50 &#x000b5;M GTP. On the other hand, when 70S ribosomes were incubated for 10 min without IF3, which was added at the end of the 10-min incubation, more 70S ribosomes (54.9%) were observed. Since the same amount of 70S ribosomes were observed upon incubation with IF3 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right profile) we concluded that all subunits resulted from spitting of 70S ribosomes by RRF and EF-G/GTP re-associated back to 70S ribosomes during the 10-min incubation without IF3, due to the exhaustion of 50 &#x000b5;M GTP.</p><p>To find out when the added GTP was exhausted in the above experiment, the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C was performed. In this experiment, after the 70S ribosome preparation was incubated with RRF, EF-G and GTP, for various periods (0&#x02013;10 min), IF3 and fusidic acid were added. Fusidic acid inhibits the splitting of post-termination complexes and 70S ribosomes into subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), while IF3 inhibits the association of the separated subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Therefore, the addition of these two components &#x02018;froze&#x02019; the splitting reaction at various time intervals from the onset of the energy-dependent ribosomal splitting. The splitting reaction proceeded up to 1 min because the amount of 70S ribosomes was the lowest (38.7%) at 1 min after the onset of the reaction. Longer incubation with RRF and EF-G resulted in the increase of 70S ribosomes to the final value of 54.3% at the 10-min incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, the extreme right panel). This value was almost identical to that with IF3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right panel). This was the background value of these experiments because IF3 alone split the 70S ribosomes to some extent. Taken together, we concluded that the GTP depletion caused the re-association of the ribosomal subunits indicating that the energy-dependent ribosomal splitting by RRF and EF-G was transient.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of transiently split subunits by SDGC</title><p>We postulated that the splitting of 70S ribosomes by RRF and EF-G could not be observed by SDGC unless IF3 was added to the reaction mixture. This was because, as described above, the reaction was transient and the split subunits would associate back to 70S ribosomes unless IF3 bound to the 30S subunits to stop the re-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). To prove this postulate further, the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> was performed. This experiment was done &#x02018;without IF3&#x02019; to demonstrate that one could observe the split subunits by SDGC &#x02018;even in the absence of IF3&#x02019; if we created special analytical conditions where EF-G/GTP and RRF were constantly present during the centrifugation analysis.</p><p>In the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the 70S-ribosome preparation was incubated with RRF, EF-G and GTP but &#x02018;without IF3&#x02019;. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, the reaction mixture was placed on regular SDGC containing no RRF, EF-G and GTP, centrifuged and sedimentation behavior of ribosome was examined. Clearly, no splitting of the 70S ribosome was observed, despite the splitting must have occurred in the reaction mixture as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, an identical reaction mixture was layered on the sucrose gradient containing RRF, EF-G and GTP so that the splitting reaction constantly took place during the time the ribosome sedimented through the sucrose gradient. It is clear from this figure that &#x02018;even without IF3&#x02019;, we were able to observe the splitting of 70S ribosome. The reason why the subunits were not well separated was probably because splitting and re-association were constantly occurring during the centrifugation.</p></sec><sec><title>The inhibitory effect of increased 70S ribosome concentration on its splitting was overcome by raising RRF, EF-G and GTP concentrations</title><p>Under physiological conditions, RRF and EF-G must split 20 &#x000b5;M 70S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) during the lag phase. The 70S ribosomes and subunits are in equilibrium as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A. The extent of 70S ribosomes dissociation into their subunits (50S and 30S) is determined by the equilibrium constant, <italic>K</italic>. Although the equilibrium constant is influenced by the ionic conditions, in a given milieu, an increase in the concentration of 70S ribosomes would result in an increase in the concentration of the subunits. However, as a single 70S ribosome gives rise to the two subunits (50S and 30S), the increase in the subunits is governed by the product of their concentrations. Hence, even though an increase in the concentration of 70S ribosomes would, at equilibrium, lead to an increase in the absolute concentration of the dissociated subunits, in terms of their overall percent fractions (with respect to the total ribosomes), it would be seen as a decrease in the abundance of the subunits. Since EF-G and RRF function to facilitate the reaction to the right, more EF-G, RRF and GTP are expected to be needed when 70S ribosomes are increased. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B through F, with constant concentration of factors and GTP, a gradual increase of 70S ribosomes resulted in persistently less subunit dissociation as predicted from the equation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A. With 1 &#x000b5;M 70S ribosomes, practically no splitting was observed with 0.36 mM GTP, 1 &#x000b5;M EF-G and RRF. It would have been ideal if we could use 20 &#x000b5;M ribosome (physiological concentration), but such an experiment is technically impossible.</p><p>The experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> show that the increase of GTP and the factors could overcome the effect of increased ribosome concentration. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, GTP was increased to 2 mM, but only 15.6% of 1 &#x000b5;M 70S ribosomes were split. On the other hand, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, both GTP (up to 2 mM) and factors (20 &#x000b5;M each) were increased. As noted from this figure, about 60% of the 70S ribosomes were converted to subunits. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C was conducted as a control experiment showing the background splitting with IF3 and GTP only. Since IF3 alone splits about 20% of 70S ribosomes, we concluded that about 40% of 1 &#x000b5;M 70S ribosome was converted to subunits by 20 &#x000b5;M RRF and EF-G in the presence of 2 mM GTP. The physiological concentrations of EF-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and RRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) are about 20 &#x000b5;M each, and IF3 is about 4 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of energy-dependent ribosomal splitting by RRF and EF-G</title><p>In the preceding section, we showed that both GTP and EF-G/RRF had to be raised to dissociate 1 &#x000b5;M ribosome. It is therefore important to examine the kinetic constants of the EF-G/RRF reaction to find out if the splitting reaction can take place <italic>in vivo</italic>. To obtain the kinetic constant, the reaction should be followed in real time. In the preceding publication, we showed that the real-time 70S ribosome splitting can be followed by observing the decrease of light scattering caused by ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). This is based on the principle that 70S ribosomes, due to their larger size, scatter more light than the subunits.</p><p>In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, the amount of the 70S ribosome preparation (0.15 &#x000b5;M), RRF (5 &#x000b5;M) and GTP (0.5 mM) was kept constant and various amounts of EF-G (0.5&#x02013;5 &#x000b5;M) were added to the reaction mixture. The data showed that both the rate and the steady-state level of the splitting were affected by the amount of added EF-G. This explains the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B showing that increased RRF, EF-G and GTP overcame the negative effect of increased 70S ribosomes. Most of the data were in line with the single exponential curves (solid lines). From the rates obtained with single exponential fittings as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, the Michaelis&#x02013;Menten constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> were estimated to be 0.59 &#x000b5;M and 0.35/min, respectively. The <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for the EF-G/GTP for the splitting of vacant 70S ribosome is higher than that for the translocation [0.25 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) or 0.07 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>)]. This is understandable from the observation that EF-G/ribosome-dependent GTPase is inhibited by RRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and the presence of RRF on the ribosome makes it harder for EF-G to bind to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). It should be mentioned that the ratio (ribosome/factor) was not that of <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, but this did not matter for determination of the kinetic constants of EF-G/RRF. Considering <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration of ribosome and factors, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> value of EF-G/RRF as calculated from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> suggest that the EF-G/RRF-dependent splitting of vacant 70S ribosomes must be sufficient to split ribosomes <italic>in vivo</italic> during the lag phase. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Kinetic studies on the splitting of 70S ribosomes by EF-G and RRF without IF3: decrease of ribosomal light scattering due to the splitting of the ribosomes.

In general, under poor nutritional conditions or adverse situations such as low or high culture temperature, bacterial ribosomes take the form of 70S ribosomes or 100S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), rather than polysomes. Upon shift-up, bacteria must utilize these 70S ribosomes to increase protein synthesis. In the normal growth phase, the post-termination complexes must also be split. In this paper, we establish that the splitting of vacant 70S ribosomes catalyzed by RRF and EF-G/GTP is transient. Previously, we and others could not observe the splitting by SDGC technique &#x02018;unless IF3 was added&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In contrast, one can observe the splitting &#x02018;without IF3&#x02019; with the light scattering method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) or with the subunits exchange method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). These observations are consistent with the notion that the splitting by RRF and EF-G is transient, and the split subunits have to be stabilized by IF3 to be observed with SDGC. Since the decrease of ribosomal light scattering is an indirect method and is not observing the actual subunits&#x02019; formation, there has been no direct evidence for the hypothesis that RRF and EF-G splits 70S ribosomes transiently in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system.</p><p>With the use of a limited amount of GTP, IF3 [inhibitor of the reassociation of subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>)] and fusidic acid [inhibitor of the splitting of post-termination complexes into subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)], we showed that the formation of subunits by RRF and EF-G was transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and a constant supply of GTP was necessary to keep them apart unless IF3 was added.

In contrast, the results of translocation was irreversible when the E-site was empty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Second, a single round of translocation took place with nonhydrolyzable GTP analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), though slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), while a single round of splitting, even in the presence of IF3 was strictly dependent on GTP but not on the nonhydrolyzable analog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Perhaps the inability of GMPPCP to cause the splitting may be because, in the presence of GMPPCP, the EF&#x02013;G/GMPPCP complex remains on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). The bound EF&#x02013;G/GMPPCP may function to bridge two subunits together, resulting in the inability of GMPPCP to catalyze the splitting. This possibility was strengthened by our recent observation that yeast 80S ribosomes were stabilized by eEF2 (eukaryotic homolog of EF-G) and GMPPCP (Demeshkina,N., Hirokawa,G., Kaji,A. and Kaji,H., unpublished data).</p><p>When GTP was limiting, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, only a limited amount of splitting took place because GTP was exhausted in the reaction mixtures. It was unlikely that the need for 2 mM GTP concentration for the splitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) was to stimulate the rate of the reaction because <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value of GTP for EF-G was about 20 &#x000b5;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). The requirement for 2 mM GTP to split 1 &#x000b5;M ribosome must therefore be due to the actual need for the energy to split with this amount of ribosome.</p></sec><sec><title>Does the RRF/EF-G-dependent splitting of the 70S ribosome occur <italic>in vivo</italic>?</title><p>The time course of the splitting of the 70S ribosomes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>C and 6 is in agreement with our original and other time-course studies on the disassembly of the post-termination complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). However, the velocity of the splitting as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> is much slower than that reported recently with a similar light scattering method (24). Splitting of post-termination complexes observed through the FRET change of fluorescence-labeled ribosomes with mRNA (28) was also much faster than these time courses. This may be partly because it deals with post-termination complexes and partly because the FRET change may include internal structural change before the actual physical separation of the subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). We observed that 5 &#x000b5;M EF-G split 0.1 &#x000b5;M ribosome in about 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). This means that it will take 100 min to split 20 &#x000b5;M ribosomes for 20 &#x000b5;M EF-G. Since the lag phase of <italic>E. coli</italic> is about 180 min under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>), this rate is sufficient to split most of the vacant 70S ribosomes during the lag phase. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> indicate that the shift of equilibrium due to the increase of the 70S ribosomes concentration was overcome by physiological concentrations of GTP (2 mM) and RRF/EF-G (20 &#x000b5;M each). This gives further support for the concept that RRF- and EF-G/GTP-dependent splitting of vacant 70S ribosomes takes place <italic>in vivo</italic>. In a recent paper, Pavlov <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that splitting of stored ribosomes at lag phase may be carried out by IF1 and IF3 as originally shown by Godefroy-Colburn <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) but the rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) of the vacant ribosome splitting by RRF, EF-G and IF3 were more than those by IF1 and IF3 suggesting the major role of RRF for activation of the dormant ribosomes.</p><p>However, Umekage and Ueda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) recently suggested that the splitting of 70S ribosomes by RRF and EF-G may not take place <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was based on the lack of splitting of 0.6&#x02013;1.2 &#x000b5;M ribosomes by physiological concentration of EF-G/RRF using the modified PURE buffer containing 2 mM Spd. In contrast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, in the presence of EF-G, RRF (20 &#x000b5;M each), 2 mM GTP, 0.3 mM Spd and 15 mM ptc, 0.6 &#x000b5;M ribosomes were dissociated. The concentrations of the aforementioned components were those of <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36 B37 B38">34&#x02013;38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). The con-centration of polyamine in the original PURE buffer is 1 mM Spd, 8 mM ptc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) and the polymix buffer designed to obtain maximum <italic>in vitro</italic> protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) contained 8 mM ptc and 1 mM Spd. Therefore, the Spd concentration used by Umekage and Ueda is higher not only than the physiological concentration of Spd but also than that of those buffers used by other laboratories. It appears, therefore, that the reason why Umekage and Ueda were not able to observe splitting of 70S ribosomes was the use of an unusually high concentration of Spd (2 mM).</p><p>It has been shown that paromomycin, which inhibited the RRF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>) strongly inhibited the anti-association activity of IF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) by binding to helix 69 of the 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>). It appeared that 2 mM Spd had similar inhibitory effects on the anti-association activity of IF3. This explains the lack of splitting by RRF and EF-G in the presence of 2 mM Spd even in the presence of IF3. We conclude that the RRF/EF-G-dependent splitting occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Creative Biomedical Research Institute (to G.H. and N.I.); the <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>GM60429</grant-num> to A.K.); and Nippon Paint grant (to H.K.).
