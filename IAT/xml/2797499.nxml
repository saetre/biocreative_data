How such developmentally equivalent cells become distinct from one another remains a fundamental question in developmental biology. Specification of cell fates involves the interpretation of multiple signalling pathways by individual cells. The developing eye of <italic>Drosophila </italic>has been extensively used as a model system to determine how common signalling pathways can induce the generation of cellular diversity. In particular, specification of the R7 photoreceptor cell fate has been a principal paradigm for elucidation of how cell fates are established in response to signalling cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>The adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye is comprised of approximately 800 ommatidia, with each ommatidium containing eight photoreceptor neurons surrounded by a collection of non-neuronal support cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The eye begins its development from the eye imaginal disc epithelium during mid-third larval instar, with the morphogenetic furrow progressing anteriorly across the disc, marking the onset of cell differentiation and pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Photoreceptor R8 is the first cell established in the eye, its recruitment mediated by signalling events coordinated by the furrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Three pairs of photoreceptors, R2/5, R3/4 and R1/6, are then subsequently recruited to each ommatidial cluster, their recruitment being dependent upon reiterative induction of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The last photoreceptor to be recruited is the R7 cell. Addition of non-neuronal lens secreting cone cells, supporting pigment cells, and the generation of sensory bristle cells make up the full complement of ommatidial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Induction of the R7 cell has been the most extensively studied cell differentiation event in the eye. With respect to common signalling events, the Notch (N) signalling pathway and the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), EGFR and Sevenless (Sev), have been shown to be necessary for induction of the R7 fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Loss of N signalling has been shown to cause the R7 precursor cell to adopt an R1/R6 cell fate. Conversely, ectopic N activation in R1/6 cells is sufficient to covert these cells into R7 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The ability of N to potentiate R7 development is dependent on the expression of the N ligand, Delta, in R1/6 photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, N may induce R7 fate differentiation in the presumptive R7 cell by both activating R7-cell-specific determinants, and repressing R8 cell determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Successive episodes of EGFR activation of the Ras/MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) signalling cascade has been shown to be a requirement for recruitment of all photoreceptor neurons to the ommatidium, including the R7 cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, Sev signalling is restricted to the presumptive R7 cell, with loss of Sev signalling specifically resulting in the trans-determination of the presumptive R7 cell into a non-neuronal cone cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While Sev and EGFR both feed into the same signal transduction pathway, high levels of RTK activation in the presumptive R7 cell may be required to overcome repressive mechanisms specific to the R7 cell itself (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). In the presumptive R7 cell, high levels of RTK signalling result in the expression of a novel nuclear gene <italic>phyllopod </italic>(<italic>phyl</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Phyl functions as an adaptor protein in the R7 nucleus, recruiting the neuronal inhibitor Tramtrack (Ttk) into a complex with Seven in absentia (Sina) and Ebi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Ttk RNA is alternatively spliced, giving rise to two zinc-finger DNA binding proteins, Ttk69 and Ttk88. Both Ttk isoforms share a common N-terminal region containing a BTB/POZ (Broad Complex Tramtrack Bric-a-Brac/Pox virus and Zinc finger) domain, but have alternative sets of Cys<sub>2</sub>-His<sub>2 </sub>zinc-fingers in the carboxyl fragment, resulting in the two isoforms having different DNA-binding specificities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both Ttk isoforms function to block neuronal fate specification in the third instar developing eye disc, and are presumed to be antagonists of RTK signalling, since overexpression of either isoform results in a failure of photoreceptor recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The recruitment of Ttk88 into the Sina-Ebi complex in R7 precursor cells leads to Ttk88 ubiquitination and post-translational degradation by proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Targeted degradation of Ttk88 relieves the inhibition of the neuronal cell fate, allowing R7 fate specification to proceed. Evidence suggests that Ttk69 is also targeted for degradation through induction of RTK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Additional studies have also implicated the RNA-binding protein Musashi (Msi) in the translational inhibition of Ttk69 in R1/6/7 precursor cells in the developing eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. While Ttk needs to be degraded for R7 fate specification to proceed, its presence is required for the formation of non-neuronal cone and pigment cells, highlighting the importance for tight regulatory control of cell-specific transcription factors in order to correctly specify cell fate within the developing eye disc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>The R7 cell arises from a population of undifferentiated cells surrounding the already recruited five-cell neuronal pre-cluster of R8/2/5/3/4 cells. These unspecified cells have undergone a second round of mitosis, an event required for re-population of the epithelium for the additional recruitment of the remaining photoreceptors, and non-neuronal supporting cells. The recruitment and differentiation of cells arising from the second mitotic wave requires the combinatorial inputs of N, EGFR and Sev signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Additionally, these cells require the expression of Lozenge (Lz), a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. RUNX proteins are critical in development, since loss of RUNX protein function can lead to stomach cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the development of acute myeloid leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or other severe developmental defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In its role in eye development, Lz has been described as a pre-patterning factor, since its expression within a pool of equipotent undifferentiated cells is required for the subsequent recruitment and differentiation of R1/6 and R7 cells, cone and pigment cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In the absence of Lz function, these cell types fail to correctly differentiate and excessive apoptosis in third-instar eye discs can be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Lz, in combination with other factors, is required to regulate a number of cell specific transcription factors expressed posterior to the second mitotic wave. For instance, Lz acts in a combinatorial manner with Yan, PointedP2 and Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)) to restrict <italic>D-Pax2/shaven </italic>expression to the cone cell precursors in third instar eye discs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The regulation of <italic>prospero (pros) </italic>expression in R7 and cone cells is also dependent upon a combination of upstream transcription factors, including Lz, Pointed and Yan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Lz has also been shown to negatively regulate <italic>seven-up </italic>in R7 and cone cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], <italic>deadpan </italic>(<italic>dpn</italic>) expression in cone cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], and <italic>Bar </italic>expression in R1 and R6 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Although studies have demonstrated the importance of Lz in the specification of differentiated cell types in the eye disc after the second mitotic wave, <italic>lz </italic>gene regulation itself is not fully understood. While <italic>lz </italic>expression is initially activated in undifferentiated cells by Sine Oculis (So) and Glass (Gl) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], evidence suggests that <italic>lz </italic>expression levels are up-regulated in differentiating cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. There is also some evidence to suggest that the Ras1/MAPK signalling pathway blocks the up-regulation of <italic>lz </italic>expression in undifferentiated cells through repression by the Yan protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Additional complexity to the regulation of <italic>lz </italic>gene expression is added by the findings that <italic>lz </italic>mRNA is alternatively spliced during eye development, producing a full length isoform (826aa; c3.5) and an isoform lacking exon V (705aa; &#x00394;5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]). Exon V encodes a conserved ETS interaction domain, and yeast two hybrid screens showed the direct interaction between Lz and the ETS factor PointedP2, with this interaction removed upon site directed mutagenesis of ETS interacting sequences within this exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Exon V is critical for the development of presumptive R7 cells in the third instar eye disc, since R7 precursor cells can still develop in a severely truncated <italic>lz </italic>mutant with this exon intact.</p><p>In this study, we show that R7 development in third instar eye discs is dependent upon Lz function, and that Ttk69 may play a role in the direct or indirect repression of <italic>lz </italic>gene expression in cell types competent to develop as R7 cells. We show that loss of Ttk69 function results in the development of ectopic R7 cells in third instar eye development. These ectopic R7 cells are dependent upon Lz function for their development. Conversely, overexpression of Ttk69 results in loss of all <italic>lz</italic>-dependant differentiated cell types in the developing eye disc along with a marked decrease in Lz expression in both undifferentiated and differentiated cell types. Interestingly, by re-introducing Lz into a developing eye where Ttk69 is over-expressed, we could partially rescue cells expressing the <italic>lz</italic>-dependent factors Bar, Pros and Cut. We could also partially rescue the expression of the R7-cell-specific marker Klingon. Together, these results suggest that the loss of cells in the Ttk69 over-expressing lines was largely due to the removal of Lz function.</p><p>Additionally, we show that Sina and Msi, factors upstream of Ttk69 in eye development, play a Ttk-dependent role in <italic>lz </italic>gene regulation in R7 precursor cells. The elucidation of the function of Ttk69 in <italic>lz </italic>gene repression in a subset of cells provides a possible mechanism for the tight control of <italic>lz </italic>expression required for the correct differentiation of cell types during early eye development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>lozenge </italic>mutations suppress <italic>tramtrack </italic>loss of function eye phenotypes</title><p>Lz has been shown to regulate a number of cell specific transcription factors expressed after the second mitotic wave in the developing eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] however, the regulation of <italic>lz </italic>itself is not fully understood. <italic>lz </italic>expression is initially activated in undifferentiated cells by So and Gl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and evidence also suggest that the ETS factor Yan prevents up-regulation of <italic>lz </italic>expression in undifferentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. So, Gl and Yan binding sites are all present in the <italic>lz </italic>eye-specific enhancer region, a critical functional region required for the correct expression of <italic>lz </italic>in the developing eye, located in the second intron of the <italic>lz </italic>gene (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). We conducted a multiple sequence comparison of this region across three <italic>Drosophila </italic>species, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. pseudoobscura </italic>and <italic>D. erecta</italic>, and found that binding sites for Gl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], So [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and the ETS factors Yan and PointedP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] are conserved across these <italic>Drosophila </italic>species (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Two other ETS binding sites have been identified in a second region of the eye enhancer and have been previously shown to be conserved in <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>D. erecta </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Additionally, we identified four conserved putative Ttk69 core binding sites (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]), suggesting that Ttk69 is a likely candidate to regulate <italic>lz </italic>gene expression in <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye development.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide alignment of a conserved region of the <italic>lz </italic>eye enhancer between <italic>D. erecta</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>(<italic>D.mel</italic>) and <italic>D. pseudoobscura </italic>(<italic>D. pseudo</italic>)</bold>.

The <italic>lz</italic><sup><italic>mr</italic>2 </sup>mutation is caused by a P-element insertion in the 5' untranslated region of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and adult males of this genotype exhibit minor ommatidial defects at the posterior rim of the eye, making this mutant amenable for a genetic interaction screen (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Using an allele known to result in the specific loss of Ttk69 but not Ttk88 (<italic>ttk</italic><sup>1<italic>e</italic>11</sup>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]), and an allele known to result in the loss of both Ttk69 and Ttk88 (<italic>ttk</italic><sup><italic>rm</italic>730</sup>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]), <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>clones were generated by mitotic recombination using the FLP/FRT system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] with the Flp recombinase placed under the control of the <italic>eyeless </italic>eye enhancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Additionally, a cell lethal mutation (3R3.7) was also introduced into the system, resulting in the death of the twin-spot cells homozygous for the 3R3.7 mutation, but not the <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>mutation. This leaves only <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>homozygous cells and non-recombinant heterozygous cells. As a result, <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>clones occupied the majority of the eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that loss of Ttk69 function, or both Ttk69 and Ttk88, in the eye resulted in severe degeneration of the corneal lens, with ommatidia and sensory bristles failing to properly develop (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C-D</xref>). These results were consistent with those previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Following the generation of large patches of <italic>ttk</italic><sup><italic>rm</italic>730 </sup>or <italic>ttk</italic><sup>1<italic>e</italic>11 </sup>mutant clones in <italic>lz</italic><sup><italic>mr</italic>2 </sup>hemizygote males, we observed the rescue of <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant eye phenotypes (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E-F</xref>). In <italic>lz</italic><sup><italic>mr</italic>2</sup><italic>;ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>double mutant tissue, ommatidial structure was present and the eye appeared less scarred. Furthermore, sensory bristles developed in the double mutants (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E-F</xref>), whereas they were absent in the <italic>ttk</italic><sup>- </sup>mutant tissue (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C-D</xref>). These results show that <italic>lz </italic>mutations can partially suppress the severe eye phenotypes of <italic>ttk </italic>loss of function mutants, suggesting that Lz functions downstream of, or in parallel to, Ttk in the developing eye.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>ttk </italic>loss of function phenotypes are suppressed in a <italic>lz</italic><sup><italic>mr</italic>2 </sup>mutant background</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Alternatively, Ttk69 could repress <italic>lz </italic>expression in specific pools of undifferentiated precursor cells. High magnification images of the middle disc region revealed that most, if not all, undifferentiated cells in control discs stained with the DNA marker 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Dapi) also expressed Lz (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6I'-I"</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of Ttk69 in undifferentiated cells did not cause a reduction in the number of Dapi-stained cells (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J'</xref>), but a clear reduction of Lz expression was observed (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J"</xref>).</p><p>In the differentiated region of the control disc epithelia, Lz expression was observed in R1, R6, R7 and cone cells (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K, M</xref>).

A reduction of Lz expression was observed in differentiated cells of disc epithelia where Ttk69 was over-expressed (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L, N</xref>).

These developmental roles for Ttk69 have been shown to be dependent upon the repressive activity of Ttk69. Here, we have established an interaction between <italic>ttk69 </italic>and <italic>lz </italic>mutant alleles and have shown that Ttk69 can repress <italic>lz </italic>expression in the third instar developing eye disc. Furthermore, we have shown that the development of ectopic R7 cells in <italic>ttk </italic>loss of function mutants is dependent upon the function of Lz. Our results have led us to conclude that Ttk69 may repress <italic>lz </italic>in a subset of precursor cells competent to develop as R7 cells. One important finding from our studies was that upon overexpression of Ttk69, Lz protein expression was observed in a wave of cells posterior to the furrow prior to its reduction in basally located undifferentiated cells in the posterior portion of the disc (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>). This result could reflect a delay in the onset of producing Ttk69 at levels required to repress Lz expression, or alternatively, it could highlight the ability of Ttk69 to repress <italic>lz </italic>in a subset of cells in early eye development.</p><p>Loss of Ttk69 expression in third instar eye epithelia resulted in development of ectopic <italic>lz</italic>-expressing presumptive R7 cells, revealing that only precursor cells competent to develop as R7's were affected by the loss of Ttk69 function. Overexpression of Ttk69 caused severe reduction of <italic>lz </italic>expression in all <italic>lz</italic>-dependent differentiating cell types as measured by the <italic>lz</italic><sup><italic>Gal</italic>4 </sup>driven expression of GFP, while re-introduction of the <italic>GMR-lz </italic>transgene resulted in the significant rescue of 69% of <italic>lz</italic>-dependent R7 cells. Interestingly, only 32% of R1 or R6 cells could be rescued, suggesting that genes, other than <italic>lz</italic>, are necessary for development of these cells and were affected by Ttk69 overexpression in the developing eye. Additionally, Lz protein expression was down-regulated upon overexpression of Ttk69 in both undifferentiated and differentiated cell types. Taken together, we hypothesise that Ttk69 repression of <italic>lz </italic>in eye development functions in a set of cells to control the specificity and level of <italic>lz </italic>gene expression in order to correctly specify the R7 cell.</p><p>Further support for our hypothesis comes from analysis of <italic>sina </italic>and <italic>msi </italic>mutants. Sina has been proposed to negatively regulate both Ttk isoforms in <italic>Drosophila </italic>eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

With respect to eye development, Hirota and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] proposed that Sina and Msi could function redundantly in presumptive R1 and R6 cells to negatively regulate Ttk69 expression. Our findings have supported this model, with knockdown of Ttk expression in a <italic>sina msi </italic>double mutant background resulting in the rescue of the majority of R1 and R6 cells.

Although initial reports suggested that <italic>lz </italic>was not a downstream target of the Ras1 signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a more recent study from our laboratories have shown a genetic interaction between <italic>ras1 </italic>and <italic>lz </italic>alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Additionally, expression of a constitutively active Ras1 allele under the control of <italic>sev </italic>(<italic>sev-ras1</italic><sup><italic>val</italic>12</sup>) could partially rescue adult eye defects observed in <italic>lz </italic>temperature sensitive mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Interestingly, So and Gl binding sites are also highly conserved across different <italic>Drosophila </italic>species, and are present in the same enhancer region as the Ttk69 sites. In addition, an ETS (Yan/PntP2) binding site is also highly conserved in this region. Our previous studies have indicated that Yan represses <italic>lz </italic>in eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and another study has shown that PntP2 and Ttk69 can compete for direct binding to the <italic>string </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. While we have not in this study demonstrated the direct binding of Ttk69 to the <italic>lz </italic>eye enhancer region, it remains plausible that the repression of <italic>lz </italic>by Ttk69 is direct.</p><p>In addition to its expression in undifferentiated cells, Ttk69 is also expressed in cone cells in the third instar eye epithelia, and in photoreceptor cells later in pupal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This pattern of expression correlates with its function, since Ttk69 is known to repress the neuronal fate but promote non-neuronal fate induction in third instar eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], while Ttk69 plays a positive role in photoreceptor development in pupal eye development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, the developmental role of Ttk69 in this context is likely to depend on the levels of Ttk69 expression. For example, while Ttk69 is thought to induce non-neuronal cell fates, we and others have shown that high levels of Ttk69 expression driven from either the <italic>sev</italic>-Gal4 driver, or the <italic>GMR</italic>-Gal4 driver, can inhibit both photoreceptor development and cone cell development (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Importantly, Ttk69 is not normally degraded in presumptive cone cells, yet <italic>lz </italic>expression persists in these cells, highlighting that appropriate levels of transcription factors are critical in defining the combinations of genes expressed in particular cell types. It is possible that a low titre of Ttk69 in cone cells can partially repress expression of <italic>lz</italic>, thus differentiating them from presumptive R7 cells. Indeed, R7 and cone cells arise from a developmentally equipotent group of cells known as the R7 equivalence group, and therefore subtle changes within this group of cells are necessary to mediate the correct fate outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. Alternatively, Ttk69 binding partners may be absent in cone cells, therefore impeding the ability of Ttk69 to exert it repressive effect. Whatever the case, the mechanism by which Ttk69 can promote the differentiation of some cell types, yet inhibit others is currently unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cell fate induction in the developing eye is dependant upon the expression of unique sets of transcription factors in a spatial and temporal manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Lz plays an important role as a pre-patterning factor in early eye development, since its expression in undifferentiated cells is necessary for the recruitment and subsequent differentiation of neuronal R1, R6 and R7 cells, and non-neuronal cone and pigment cells. Furthermore, Lz acts in combinatorial manner with a number of factors, in a cell specific manner, to transcriptionally activate, or repress, transcription factors expressed after the second mitotic wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is therefore critical that <italic>lz </italic>itself is tightly regulated in differentiating cells. This regulatory constriction must extend to the level of <italic>lz </italic>expression, since expression levels of a gene can greatly influence the specification of individual cell types. For example, functional analysis of the cell fate specification gene <italic>seven-up </italic>in the developing eye epithelia revealed that if ectopic expression levels of Svp are low in R7 and cone cell precursors, cone cells will be converted to R7 cells, whereas if levels are too high, R7 and cone cells will adopt an outer photoreceptor fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising to consider that Ttk69 may, in part, regulate the levels of <italic>lz </italic>expression in a specific pool of equipotent cells to allow for the correct fate specification of cells specified after the second mitotic wave.</p><p>Lz is a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, and these highly conserved proteins play key roles in the regulation of a number of developmental processes such as epithelial development, hematopoesis and neurogenesis in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>] and in eye development and hematopoesis in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. Similarities between mammalian Runx and <italic>Drosophila </italic>Lz proteins extend to the level of gene regulation and protein-protein interaction, with both Runx1 and Lz being alternatively spliced to remove an ETS interaction domain, and both proteins having the ability to physically interact with the ETS-1 transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. Tramtrack69 is a member of the BTB/POZF family of transcription factors, a diverse group of proteins functioning in many biological processes, including cell cycle progression, B cell fate determination and hematopoietic stem cell fate determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. The human genome encodes approximately 60 POZF proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>], with at least one of these proteins having been demonstrated to be involved in antagonising Runx activity in T cell fate specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>]. Therefore, the elucidation of mechanisms and factors involved in Lz regulation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>will greatly enhance our understanding of Runx regulation in key mammalian developmental processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>strains</title><p>Most <italic>lz </italic>stocks were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center, Indiana, Mel Green (University of California at Davis) and Reinhard Stocker (University of Fribourg, Switzerland). <italic>GMR-lz c3.5 </italic>was obtained from Utpal Banerjee (U.C.L.A).
