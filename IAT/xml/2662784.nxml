Overexpression of RRM2 significantly enhances the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor. Angiogenesis is critical to tumor malignancy; it plays an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis. It is important to investigate whether the angiogenic potential of tumor is affected by RRM2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We examined the expression of antiangiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in two RRM2-overexpressing KB cells: KB-M2-D and KB-HURs. We found that TSP-1 was significantly decreased in both KB-M2-D and KB-HURs cells compared to the parental KB and mock transfected KB-V. Simultaneously, RRM2-overexpressing KB cells showed increased production of VEGF mRNA and protein. In contrast, attenuating RRM2 expression via siRNA resulted in a significant increased TSP-1 expression in both KB and LNCaP cells; while the expression of VEGF by the two cells was significantly decreased under both normoxia and hypoxia. In comparison with KB-V, overexpression of RRM2 had no significant effect on proliferation in vitro, but it dramatically accelerated in vivo subcutaneous growth of KB-M2-D. KB-M2-D possessed more angiogenic potential than KB-V, as shown in vitro by its increased chemotaxis for endothelial cells and in vivo by the generation of more vascularized tumor xenografts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest a positive role of RRM2 in tumor angiogenesis and growth through regulation of the expression of TSP-1 and VEGF.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) plays an essential role in catalyzing conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding 2'-deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, a rate-limiting step in the production of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-diphosphates (dNTP) required for DNA synthesis and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Human ribonucleotide reductase consists of two subunits: RRM1 and RRM2, both proteins are required for enzymatic activity. The cellular RRM1 protein level remains relatively stable throughout the entire cell cycle, whereas RRM2 is only expressed during the late G<sub>1</sub>/early S phase, and degraded in late S phase. The activity of RNR, and therefore DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, is controlled during the cell cycle by the synthesis and degradation of RRM2 subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. RRM2 itself is a dimmer of two 44 kDa moieties, each containing non-heme iron that stabilizes a unique tyrosyl-free radical required for enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently cloned p53R2, a new RNR family member, encodes a protein with striking similarity to RRM2, which is induced by UV light, &#x003b3;-irradiation or adriamycin in a wild type p53-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. p53R2 directly participates in p53-directed repair of damaged DNA through generating a RNR holoenzyme with RRM1 to synthesize the dNTPs for DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that increased RNR enzymatic activity is tightly associated with tumor progression and malignancy. Alteration in the activity of RNR has been identified in a variety of tumor cells obtained from mouse and human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Apart from the well-known role in ribonucleotide reduction, several studies have indicated that RRM1 and RRM2 may play opposite roles in controlling malignant progression of tumor cells. Studies had identified that overexpression of both mice R1 and human RRM1 significantly inhibited <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor growth and decreased metastatic potential of tumor through activating PTEN pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Conversely, overexpression of mouse R2 markedly enhanced cellular transforming potential of various oncogenes; and increased malignant potential of transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We and others had reported that overexpression of human RRM2 could enhance the invasive and metastatic potential of various human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our recent study had also shown that the RRM2 protein level in human colon cancer was positively correlated to the metastasis of colon cancer, and elevated RRM2 may serve as a potential biomarker for metastasis of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessel from pre-existing vessel, plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological conditions including embryonic development, wound healing, tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Angiogenesis is tightly controlled by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Among many angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most critical and specific factors that stimulate both physiological and pathological angiogenesis; the expression of VEGF are induced by growth factors and hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Whereas, among many antiangiogenic factors, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a very potent angiogenesis inhibitor, and down-regulation of TSP-1 has been suggested to alter tumor growth by modulating angiogenesis in a variety of tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Oncogenes activation and loss of tumor suppressor genes activity can directly regulate the expression of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors in an opposite way thus determining the overall angiogenic activity of tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In tumor cells, VEGF is also stimulated by mutated <italic>ras</italic>, v-<italic>src</italic>, c-<italic>fos </italic>and c-<italic>jun etc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The expression of TSP-1 is upregulated by the tumor suppressor gene, p53, and down-regulated by oncogenes such as myc and ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Tumor angiogenesis is a hallmark of malignancy; it plays an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the implication of the RRM2 in tumor angiogenesis is not closely studied. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the impact of the RRM2 on tumor angiogenesis through its regulating the expression of proangiogenic factor VEGF, and antiangiogenic factor TSP-1. For the first time, we found overexpression of RRM2 alone reduces TSP-1 expression; induced VEGF expression in tumor cells, resulted in a tumor xenograft with more angiogenic potential and accelerated growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results indicate a positive role of RRM2 in tumor angiogenesis and progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Human oropharyngeal carcinoma KB cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), were cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C on plastic tissue culture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

The induction of VEGF expression could be regulated at the level of either mRNA or protein. Measured by Q-RT-PCR, we found that in the two RRM2-overexpressing cells VEGF mRNA was significantly increased (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). Hypoxia condition in tumor has been shown to be an important stimulus for VEGF gene expression as well as tumor angiogenesis. To determine the effect of RRM2 on VEGF expression under hypoxia, we compared VEGF mRNA and protein in KB-V and KB-M2-D cells. The results showed that hypoxia (1% oxygen for 16h) upregulated VEGF by ~2 fold at protein levels (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) or ~4-fold at mRNA (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) in both cells.

High RNR enzymatic activity is associated with tumor progression and resistance to various cellular stressors such as chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Increased RRM2 and RNR enzymatic activity were reported to present in highly metastatic tumor cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, RRM2 is also an important therapeutic target for DNA replication-dependent diseases such as cancer. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that RRM2 plays additional roles in determining the malignant potential of tumor cells. For example, elevated expression of RRM2 has been found to increase the drug-resistant properties of cancer cells and significantly enhance the invasive potential of many human cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], whereas knockdown of RRM2 expression results in the reversal of drug-resistance and suppressed tumor growth, and decreased metastasis potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

These data suggest two subunits of RNR play opposing roles in tumor progression and malignancy; beside they cooperate in dNTP production.</p><p>Tumor angiogenesis is necessary for the growth and metastasis of many tumors. Potential of angiogenic switch is a critical character of tumor malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tumor angiogenesis and metastatic formation are intrinsically connected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Accumulating evidences support RRM2 possesses oncogene-like properties; it plays a potential role in tumor malignancy and metastasis. In this study, we therefore focused on the effect of RRM2 on tumor angiogenesis. We investigated the effect of overexpression of RRM2 on the production of angiogenesis regulatory factors in human cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that overexpression of RRM2 decreased the production of TSP-1 and increased that of VEGF in KB cells. Because hypoxia is a critical factor regulating VEGF expression through stabilizing its transcriptional factor HIF-1 protein and it is also an essential factor for tumor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We also examined the effect of RRM2 on VEGF expression under hypoxia condition. The data demonstrated that under hypoxia condition overexpression of RRM2 further increased VEGF protein in KB cells. To further confirm the regulation, we measured TSP-1 and VEGF expression in KB and LNCaP cells after RRM2 knockdown by its specific siRNA. Contrast to overexpression of RRM2, we found knockdown of RRM2 expression caused an increased TSP-1 and decreased VEGF expression in both KB and LNCaP cells. Considering the potential therapeutic application of RNA interference for RRM2 such as siRNA, antisense oligo-nucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], our above finding is potentially important, and it also indicates that the therapy based on RNA interference for RRM2 may potentially inhibit tumor angiogenesis beside its known inhibitory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The changes in the expression of angiogenic factors: TSP-1 and VEGF induced by RRM2 in tumor cells did result in increased angiogenic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, as shown by the increased chemotactic activity for endothelial cells. Moreover, tumors generated <italic>in vivo </italic>by RRM2-overexpressing cells showed a higher vascular density compared to controls. We supposed that higher vascular density might partially contribute to growth advantage of RRM2-overexpressing cancer cells. Consistent with what we expected, the increased vascularization caused by overexpression of RRM2 did confer a growth advantage to RRM2-overexpressing cancer cells.</p><p>VEGF is significantly associated with poor outcome in human various malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The increased production of VEGF is significant for various cancers development. Exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia is a common finding in solid tumors. Hypoxia induces a myriad of adaptive changes within tumor cells, which result in increased anaerobic glycolysis, new blood vessel formation and genetic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistently, a previous study by Graff et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] also found that elevated RNR caused by overexpression of RRM2 could overrule long-lasting arrest of DNA-synthesis after severe hypoxia insult, and cancer cells with elevated RRM2 were more resistant to hypoxia. TSP-1 is an important inhibitor of angiogenesis, and its suppression is crucial for the angiogenic switch in many tumor models [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]]. Additionally, TSP-1 is an inhibitor of invasion; it inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), which causes release of vascular endothelial growth factor sequestered in the extracellular matrix, thereby increasing invasion potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Coincidentally, a recent study of Duxbury et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] also found that overexpression of RRM2 increased pancreatic adenocarcinoma cellular invasiveness and MMP-9 expression.</p><p>The earlier study by Wright et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that mouse RRM2 synergize with a variety of oncogenes including h-ras, h-rac, v-src, a-raf, c-myc, etc in cellular transformation and tumorigenic potential to normal fibroblast cells through a variety of signal pathways. For example, cooperation with Ras, overexpression of mouse RNR small subunit R2 significantly increases membrane-associated Raf-1 protein and MAPK-2 activity, finally further activates MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Oncogenes not only promote aberrant cellular mitogenesis, but also have an important impact on tumor formation and growth through an indirect mechanism, namely, by driving tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

Additionally, some of them &#x02013; for example, h-ras and c-myc &#x02013; also significantly up-regulate VEGF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Contrast to oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes such as p53, Rb and PTEN etc stimulate TSP-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Interestingly, our previous study found that in cancer cells, even without any stress RRM2 and p53R2 are bound to wild-type p53 protein. In response to UV irradiation, RRM2 and p53R2 dissociate themselves from p53 and form RNR with RRM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is interesting to further examine whether elevated RRM2 has any impact on p53 function through the protein-protein interaction. Coincidently, we found that knockdown of RRM2 leads a significantly elevated p53 protein in both KB and LNCaP (unpublished data); we are focusing on the correlations among these proteins. Since p53 acts as a negative controller of angiogenesis, and the loss of functional p53 results in high VEGF and low TSP-1 production, with consequent increase in angiogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The mechanisms through which RRM2 regulate TSP-1 and VEGF expression requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overexpression of RRM2 in KB cell suppressed TSP-1 expression, and increased VEGF expression.
