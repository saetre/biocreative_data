Mounting evidence strongly suggests that the immune system plays an important role in angiogenesis. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as Interferon gamma (IFN&#x003b3;); interleukin-6 (IL-6); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;); Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1&#x003b2;) are the major cytokines in the pathogenesis of ocular inflammatory diseases. Many of the proinflammatory cytokines are involved in inflammatory angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. However, IFN&#x003b3; is thought to be an anti-angiogenic cytokine, due to its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell growth and capillary formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>].</p><p>The classic signaling events induced by IFN&#x003b3; are through the Janus kinase (Jak) pathway and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) pathway. The cascade of signal transduction is initiated upon the binding of dimeric IFN&#x003b3; to its receptor, followed by the activation of the receptor-associated Jak1 and Jak2, which in turn phosphorylate Stat1. Stat1 then translocates into the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor. Beyond the Jak/Stat1 pathway, IFN&#x003b3; can also activate the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The roles of these pathways in IFN&#x003b3;-induced biologic effects, however, have not been clearly defined.</p><p>We recently reported treating a patient with multifocal choroiditis associated with choroidal neovasculization (CNV) with rapamycin, an mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. CNV occurs in many intraocular inflammatory diseases such as uveitis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and others. Among them, AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the United States for people over 60 years old. In the wet, or exudative, AMD, choroidal blood vessels grow through Bruch&#x02019;s membrane into the subretinal space, causing CNV, and resulting in accumulation of blood beneath the retina. CNV is present in only 10% of patients with AMD, but is responsible for 90% of cases with severe vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to play an important role in this process. It has been associated with choroidal neovascular membranes, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and maculae with AMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Intraocular delivery of anti-VEGF therapies is now widely accepted as a treatment for the wet form of AMD. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN&#x003b3; plays an important role in the pathogenesis of intraocular inflammatory disease. In the aqueous and vitreous of uveitis patients, IFN&#x003b3; can reach levels greater than 100 pg/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. Mounting evidence supports the notion that AMD may be an inflammation-driven disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Although there are no studies showing the increased expression of IFN&#x003b3; in AMD patients, it has been reported that IFN&#x003b3; induces complement factor H (CFH) expression from RPE cells, implying that IFN&#x003b3; has a potential role in AMD pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. In this study, we provide evidence that IFN&#x003b3; promoted human VEGF secretion from human RPE cells. Unexpectedly, IFN&#x003b3;-induced hVEGF secretion was not through the classic IFN&#x003b3; Jak/Stat1 pathway, but through the PI-3K/mTOR/p70-S6K-translational regulation pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>ARPE-19 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle&#x02019;s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin (100 U/ml each), and 2&#x000a0;mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

We used both primary fRPE and an adult RPE cell line, ARPE-19, to detect the effect of IFN&#x003b3; on VEGF mRNA expression. We first treated fRPE cells with IL-6, IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, and TGF&#x003b2;1 overnight. Cells were collected and RNA was purified for real time PCR assay using GAPDH as an internal standard.

Another set of data showed a similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>, experiment 2). We also used 18S rRNA as an internal standard and found similar results. We then examined whether the same effect was also observed in ARPE-19 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>, IFN&#x003b3; started to induce <italic>VEGF</italic> expression at 6 h. At 24 h after treatment, IFN&#x003b3; greatly induced <italic>VEGF</italic> RNA expression (p&#x0003c;0.01). Since we obtained similar results using both fRPE and ARPE-19 cells, considering that cell accessibility and adult RPE cells are more relevant to the pathological situation, we used ARPE-19 cells in the subsequent experimental settings. We next performed ELISA experiments to measure hVEGF secretion of ARPE-19 cells 48 h after cytokine treatment. As shown in the dose-dependent induction of hVEGF expression from ARPE-19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>), 1.0 ng/ml IFN&#x003b3; started to induce hVEGF expression, with the highest effect at 25 ng/ml. However, the anti-proinflammatory cytokine, IL-10, did not affect hVEGF expression in ARPE-19 cells. MTT assay was used to detect cell number and viability after IFN&#x003b3; treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, IFN&#x003b3; slightly reduced ARPE-19 cell number and viability.

RPE is a single layer of epithelial cells in the back of the eye, acting as the outer blood-retinal barrier. Dysregulation of RPE has been implicated in AMD pathogenesis and ocular inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. IFN&#x003b3; is a crucial modulator of the immune system. It is produced by specific subsets of T lymphocytes and NK cells, and plays an important role in ocular pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. IFN&#x003b3; has a pleiotropic effect in the ocular environment. Not only is it involved in local inflammatory response, but it also magnifies this response in the outer retina. It upregulates the expression of MHC class II, ICAM-1, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in RPE cells, which collectively lead to alteration of RPE antigenic properties, and activation and recruitment of leukocytes in the retina, further contributing to ocular immunopathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Moreover, IFN&#x003b3; is also reported to increase the expression of reactive oxygen species, which has been implicated in ocular inflammation and retinal degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. The data from IFN&#x003b3; transgenic animal models also support this notion. Geiger et al. found IFN&#x003b3; transgenic mice developed intraocular disease, manifested as inflammatory-cell infiltration and photoreceptor loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Egwuagu and his associates also reported IFN&#x003b3; transgenic mice had higher MHC class II expression in the eye, and the mice developed microphthalmia and microphakia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>]. The ectopic expression of IFN&#x003b3; in photoreceptors disturbed the intraocular immune privilege in transgenic mice and prevented the induction of anterior chamber-associated immune deviation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. In IFN&#x003b3;-transgenic rats, it has been reported that IFN&#x003b3; accelerated the onset of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Interestingly, IFN&#x003b3; also plays a protective role in regulating ocular immune response. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] reported that IFN&#x003b3; upregulated human CFH expression. CFH has been implicated in AMD pathogenesis and is an important component of downregulatory intraocular environment (DIE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] found that application of IFN&#x003b3; to the anterior surface of the rat eye could remove extra fluid in the subretinal region. This protective role in regulating retinal hydration may have implications for ocular pathogenesis, and more specifically, for macular edema-associated AMD and uveitis. In the mouse EAU models, it has been shown that IFN&#x003b3; has a protective effect on EAU development, which contradicts the effects observed from human and rat EAU models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Overall, the mechanisms of IFN&#x003b3; function in different species need to be further explored.</p><p>Earlier reports emphasized that IFN&#x003b3; is an anti-angiogenic cytokine. It inhibits the growth of endothelial cells (ECs) and induces the apoptosis of ECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. In addition, treatment of ECs with IFN&#x003b3; results in a decreased expression of the platelet EC-adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1, which is constitutively expressed by the vascular endothelium and concentrates at intercellular junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. The regulation of PECAM-1 expression by IFN&#x003b3; is thought to affect leukocyte trafficking, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability. Moreover, IFN&#x003b3; acts on ECs by inducing IFN&#x003b3;-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression, which inhibits angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. The proposed inhibitory effect of IFN&#x003b3; on angiogenesis is not solely due to its direct activity on ECs. IFN&#x003b3; differentially regulates IP-10 and IL-8 expression in RPE cells. Along with IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1;, IFN&#x003b3; induced at least ten-fold higher IP-10 than IL-8, suggesting its direct anti-angiogenic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. Hooks and associates showed that IFN&#x003b3; acts as an anti-angiogenic cytokine in the human cornea by inhibiting VEGFA and enhancing soluble VEGF-R1 secretion in human corneal stromal fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Tumor cells respond to IFN&#x003b3; by suppressing the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2 genes, which are involved in the invasion and angiogenesis process of malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. Betty et al. showed the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells to be IFN&#x003b3; dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Ray et al. reported that IFN&#x003b3; suppresses VEGFA expression in monocyte-macrophages through translational silencing, by inducing the IFN&#x003b3;-activated inhibitor of translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Furthermore, IFN&#x003b3; has been shown to downregulate the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. That and macrophage colony stimulating factor have been reported to be ideal targets for treating neovascular diseases and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its anti-angiogenic effect, there are also observations supporting its pro-angiogenic effects. An example is IFN&#x003b3;&#x02019;s reported angiogenic effects from enhancing the secretion of VEGF from human keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. Shi et al. treated fRPE cells with IFN&#x003b3;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and a TNF&#x003b1; cytokine cocktail. They found that a significant amount of cytokines and chemokines were upregulated, and that angiogenic cytokines were secreted at a greater rate than angiostatic cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Here, we are more focused on IFN&#x003b3;&#x02019;s effect on human RPE, because of the RPE&#x02019;s central role in macular pathology involving the posterior pole. We therefore used human RPE cells as a model. For the first time, we have shown that although IFN&#x003b3; slightly decreased ARPE-19 cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>), IFN&#x003b3; induced VEGFA expression in ARPE-19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Compared to IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, and TGF&#x003b2;, IFN&#x003b3; had a more robust VEGF-promoting effect at both the RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,E</xref>), indicating that IFN&#x003b3; is a versatile mediator in angiogenesis dysregulation associated with macular ocular pathology involving the back of the eye.</p><p>The anti-proliferative, proapoptotic effects of IFN&#x003b3; have been largely attributed to the activation of the Jak/Stat1 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. However, several reports indicate that IFN&#x003b3; activation of the Jak/Stat pathway is not sufficient to account for all the biologic actions of IFN&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Beyond the Jak/Stat1 pathway, IFN&#x003b3; can also activate the MAPK and PI-3K/mTOR pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. However, the role of these pathways in IFN&#x003b3;-induced biologic effects has not been clearly defined. In this study, we provide evidence that the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway is important for IFN&#x003b3;-induced VEGF expression in human RPE cells. The PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, along with Akt SiRNA, greatly decreased IFN&#x003b3;-induced hVEGF secretion from RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C,D,F</xref>). On the other hand, neither inhibitor affected IFN&#x003b3;-induced Stat1 phophorylation/activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the IFN&#x003b3;-induced hVEGF expression was not affected by SiRNA targeted to Stat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), implying that the classic Jak/Stat1 pathway of IFN&#x003b3; is not involved in this VEGF-promoting effect. The precise mechanisms that determine how the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway affects VEGF expression remain unclear and need to be further explored.</p><p>We believe these observations have direct clinical implications. Even though the exact mechanisms leading to AMD remain obscure, early reports in the 1980s already suggested immune system involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Recently, several genetic associations in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>] further implicate immune-driven mechanisms in AMD. mTOR is a crucial molecule in mediating inflammation-induced angiogenesis. In addition to IFN&#x003b3;, which has been shown here to affect the pathway, other proangiogenic factors, including TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, basic fibroblast factor (bFGF), and VEGF, are dependent on the mTOR/translational pathway to contribute to the overall angiogenic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>]. In line with this notion, an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, appears to be a suitable option to treat CNV that is secondary to any pathologic process involving the RPE, including AMD. In addition, rapamycin is also an immunosuppressant. It inhibits T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, in response to both antigenic and cytokine stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. The dual effects of this agent may be useful in treating the inflammatorily driven CNV. We are currently evaluating the use of rapamycin in treating AMD patients with CNV. The data suggest that rapamycin appears to affect the clinical course of AMD [data not shown]. The availabilities of IFN&#x003b3; transgenic or knockout animal models may also help to elucidate the effect of rapamycin on ocular neovascularization. While we have emphasized the important role the mTOR/translational pathway plays in IFN&#x003b3;-induced VEGF expression, we cannot exclude the possibility of other signaling pathways that are also important for this process. Kaur et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>] recently showed that PI-3K plays a dual regulatory role in IFN&#x003b3; signaling by controlling IFN&#x003b3;-dependent transcriptional regulation of IFN-sensitive genes, and by simultaneously regulating the subsequent initiation of mRNA translation for such genes. Consistent with their results, we found that IFN&#x003b3; could promote VEGF mRNA expression, as well as protein secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A,D</xref>).</p><p>Our findings provide further mechanistic insight into the pathways leading to CNV in disorders in which, like AMD, perturbation of RPE plays an integral role in disease pathogenesis. Our investigation&#x02019;s elucidation of molecular signaling in IFN&#x003b3;-induced VEGF expression provides further justification for therapeutic interventions to be carefully applied in the clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Drs.
