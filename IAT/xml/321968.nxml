Here, we describe the structure of this small B2 RNA. A cDNA library was prepared from low-molecular-weight cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNA isolated from Ehrlich carcinoma cells and the clones which hybridized to B2 sequence were selected. The clones were sequenced and shown to contain B2 sequences followed by a poly(A) tract. The sequences of the cloned B2 RNAs different from each other by 3-10%, being similar in this respect to genomic B2 copies. Thus, B2 RNA is transcribed from many different B2 sequences in the genome. The 5'-ends of B2 RNA at least in most molecules coincide with the beginning of B2 genomic sequence. The poly(A) segments located at the 3'-end of small B2 RNA are the same size as in mRNA molecules, suggesting posttranscriptional formation. In some clones, additional sequences were detected between the 3'-end of B2 sequence and the poly(A) stretch. They seem to result from a lesion in the RNA polymerase III terminator in the corresponding B2 sequences. The possible significance of B2 sequences and small B2 RNA is discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0039-a" xlink:role="6430"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0041-a" xlink:role="6432"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6423"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0033.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6424"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0034.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6425"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0035.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6426"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0036.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6427"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6428"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6429"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6430"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6431"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6432"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6433"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6434"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6435"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6436"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00312-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6437"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
