This process begins at approximately embryonic day (E) 8.0 with the ventral foregut positioned such that a portion of it lies immediately adjacent to the cardiac mesoderm with the most ventral region distal from the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Growth factor signalling from the cardiac mesoderm and septum transversum mesenchyme specifies the underlying endoderm to adopt a hepatic fate such that by the 6&#x02013;7 somite stage hepatic gene expression can be detected in the ventral foregut endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Concurrent with these events, the most distal region of the foregut endoderm starts to express pancreatic genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Specification of these cells is dependent on their position being outside of the proximity of the hepatic inductive effects of the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Closure of the foregut pocket positions the newly specified hepatic and ventral pancreatic endoderm in close apposition to inductive mesenchyme that subsequently drives the proliferation and expansion of these organs from approximately E9.0 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]).</p><p>Molecular and genetic analyses have identified several transcription factors central to these processes including forkhead box proteins A1 and A2 (FOXA1 and FOXA2), the homeodomain transcription factors HEX and PROX1, and the PTF1a subunit of the PTF1 transcription factor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). Careful analysis of transcription factor function in the foregut endoderm has, in turn, helped define the fundamental contributions that cell proliferation and transient tissue interactions make to both hepatic and pancreatic development (for reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]).</p><p>The GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors have also been shown to be involved in the differentiation of the endoderm in several evolutionarily diverse organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the mouse, GATA4, 5 and 6 are expressed in the definitive endoderm and its derivatives, and are required to modulate endodermal gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, we have demonstrated previously that hepatic development is blocked at the primary liver bud stage in embryos derived from <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells by tetraploid complementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In these embryos, low levels of hepatic mRNAs were detected in the foregut endoderm at the 6&#x02013;7 somite stage suggesting that <italic>Gata6 </italic>is not essential for hepatic specification. However, the hepatic endoderm subsequently failed to expand and commit to a normal liver developmental program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>GATA4 was the first GATA factor to be implicated in development of the ventral foregut. <italic>In vivo </italic>footprinting analyses revealed that GATA4 occupied the hepatic <italic>Albumin </italic>(<italic>Alb1</italic>) enhancer in ventral foregut endoderm prior to the onset of hepatic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The ability of GATA4, in conjunction with FOXA2, to reposition nucleosomes around this enhancer has lead to the hypothesis that GATA4 potentiates hepatic gene expression. In this model, GATA4 acts with FoxA to ensure that hepatic transcriptional regulatory elements are structurally capable of interacting with liver-expressed transcriptional activators whose own expression could be induced by paracrine signals from surrounding tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. From a developmental perspective, GATA4 would act as a 'pioneer' transcription factor that, along with FOXA, would help define the competency of the endoderm to adopt a hepatic fate.</p><p>Further support for GATA4 contributing to hepatic and pancreatic development also comes from studies in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In these studies, morpholino-mediated depletion of zfGATA4 resulted in defective development of multiple organs including the liver and pancreas. With regard to development of the liver, depletion of either zfGATA4 or zfGATA6 resulted in a failure of the liver lineage to expand although hepatic specification was intact. However, when both zfGATA4 and zfGATA6 were simultaneously depleted there was no indication that the liver had initiated development, suggesting that in zebrafish zfGATA4 and zfGATA6 had redundant roles during the onset of hepatic development but had independent roles during organogenesis of the liver.</p><p>The phenotype observed in zebrafish depleted of zfGATA6 closely resembles that described for mouse embryos generated from <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells, implying that the role for GATA6 is evolutionarily conserved between fish and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, there has been debate over whether zfGATA5 is in fact the functional homolog of mouse GATA4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and so it remained an open question as to whether GATA4 is required for development of the mammalian liver. Development of <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryos arrests prior to the onset of pancreatic and liver specification due to deficiencies in the differentiation of the extraembryonic endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, as is the case for <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, this early embryonic lethality can be circumvented by providing <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos with a <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>extraembryonic endoderm by tetraploid embryo complementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We therefore used this approach to generate post-gastrulation stage embryos from <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells in order to definitively determine whether GATA4 controls development of the mammalian pancreas or liver. Examination of such <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cell-derived embryos revealed that GATA4 is necessary for expansion of the primary hepatic rudiment and is required for the onset of ventral pancreatic development but dispensable for formation of the dorsal pancreas.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>GATA4 is expressed in multiple tissues with roles in development of the pancreas and liver</title><p>As a first step toward defining GATA4 function in the development of the liver and pancreas, we carried out a detailed analysis of GATA4 expression in these tissues in 4 to 25 somite stage (E8.0 &#x02013; E10.0) embryos using immunohistochemistry. We have previously demonstrated that the antibody used in these studies specifically recognizes GATA4 because it does not detect nuclear staining in GATA4 null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. At the 4 somite stage, the ventral definitive endoderm, which will give rise to the liver and ventral pancreas, is continuous with the extraembryonic visceral endoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,B</xref>). HNF4&#x003b1; is expressed exclusively in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm at this stage and clearly demarcates this tissue from the ventral foregut endoderm, which lies adjacent to the cardiac mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition to being expressed in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm, GATA4 is also detected in the ventral foregut endoderm as well as in the cardiac mesoderm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). By the 16 somite stage, closure of the foregut and morphogenetic movements of the splanchnic and lateral mesoderm has drawn the newly specified hepatic and pancreatic rudiments within the endoderm away from the cardiac mesoderm and into contact with surrounding mesenchyme of the septum transversum. At this stage, GATA4 is detected throughout the foregut endoderm including the liver bud. However, GATA4 levels within the liver bud appear to be lower than that observed in the adjacent septum transversum mesenchyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), the endothelial cells that surround the bud, and the ventral pancreas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Following formation of the primary liver bud, the hepatic endoderm proliferates, delaminates, and migrates into the septum transversum mesenchyme, while the pancreatic bud maintains an epithelial morphology. In 25 somite stage embryos GATA4 expression is absent from cells delaminating from the primary liver bud. The loss of GATA4 expression in this region appears to be specific to the cells that are committed to the hepatic lineage because intense GATA4 staining can be identified within the remainder of the foregut as well as in the septum transversum mesenchyme and ventral pancreatic bud (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These data demonstrate that GATA4 expression is highly dynamic during the time that the ventral foregut endoderm differentiates to produce the liver and ventral pancreatic cell lineages. These expression analyses, which yield data that are similar to those reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], are consistent with a role for GATA4 in the potentiation of hepatic gene expression prior to formation of the liver bud and in controlling development of the pancreas. However, the observation that GATA4 expression in the hepatic endoderm is rapidly extinguished as the hepatoblasts delaminate from the foregut suggests that any cell autonomous role for GATA4 during hepatogenesis is likely to be restricted to the earliest phases of hepatic development. Moreover, our finding that GATA4 is also highly expressed in the cardiac mesoderm, septum transversum mesenchyme, and endothelial cells, all of which contribute paracrine signals that are necessary for hepatic and pancreatic development, suggests that GATA4 could also regulate endoderm development indirectly.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>GATA4 is expressed in multiple tissues that contribute to development of the ventral pancreas and liver</bold>.

The hepatic transcription factor HNF4&#x003b1; is expressed in the liver bud from around the 15 somite stage, and we were able to detect HNF4&#x003b1; expression within the hepatic endoderm of both <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E,F</xref>) by immunohistochemistry using an antibody that specifically identifies HNF4&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Cumulatively, these data suggest that specification of the hepatic lineage occurs in the absence of GATA4 although the cells of the <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>liver bud fail to delaminate and expand. To confirm that hepatic specification occurs relatively normally in the absence of GATA4, we examined the expression of several hepatic genes in the ventral endoderm of <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos at E8.0&#x02013;8.5, which is approximately the developmental stage at which the hepatic lineage is specified. RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from the ventral foregut endoderm (demarcated by black arrowheads in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) of individual <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, we were able to detect <italic>Gata4 </italic>transcripts in the ventral endoderm of <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>but not <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, which demonstrates that the dissected samples of definitive foregut endoderm were not contaminated by GATA4-expressing wild type (tetraploid) extraembryonic visceral endoderm. The exclusion of contaminating extraembryonic endoderm from the isolated samples is crucial because the extraembryonic endoderm expresses many of the same genes as the hepatic endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and so the presence of this tissue could potentially confound interpretation of collected data.

Therefore, although hepatic development is compromised in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos, the endoderm retains the capacity to form a pseudo-stratified epithelial bud and initiate a program of hepatic gene expression.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of hepatic gene expression in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos</bold>.

This implies that the failure of the liver bud to expand and invade the surrounding mesenchyme is likely to reflect a non-cell autonomous role for GATA4 during hepatogenesis. Consistent with this proposal, GATA4 was also identified in the cardiac mesoderm, septum transversum mesenchyme and endothelium surrounding the liver bud, all of which are crucial for the development of the hepatic domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have previously shown that although loss of GATA4 affects development of the ventricular cardiomyocytes, there is relatively little impact on cardiac gene expression possibly due to compensation by GATA6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A comparison of transverse sections from <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos reveals that the septum transversum mesenchyme, which lies adjacent to the presumptive liver bud in control embryos, is absent in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). The apparent absence of this mesenchyme was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G,H</xref>) for WT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These data are consistent with our previously published analyses of the septum transversum and proepicardium in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Next, we examined whether endothelial cells, which normally line the ventro-lateral surface of the hepatic epithelium, were present in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos.

As expected, we were able to detect PDX1 expression by immunohistochemistry in the ventral pancreas of <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>embryos at E9.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In contrast, PDX1 expression was undetectable in the equivalent endodermal region in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Indeed, we failed to observe any PDX1 expression in the ventral aspect of the entire gut endoderm (data not shown). However, we were able to detect PDX1, as well as a second pancreatic protein HB9, in the dorsal pancreatic domain of both control and mutant embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,F,G</xref>) implying that the loss of GATA4 specifically affects development of the ventral pancreas.</p><p>The pancreatic phenotype described above exhibits many similarities to the ventral pancreatic defects observed in <italic>Hex </italic>null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The hepatic and ventral pancreatic lineages are specified from two distinct domains of the ventral foregut endoderm. Signals from the overlying cardiac mesoderm instruct the more dorsal endoderm to assume a hepatic fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The ventral-most endoderm is beyond the influence of these signals and as a result adopts a pancreatic fate. In <italic>Hex </italic>null embryos, reduced proliferation of the ventral foregut endoderm results in a failure to elaborate endoderm beyond the hepatic inductive influence of the cardiac mesoderm. Consequently, the ventral pancreas is not specified, with PDX1 expression absent in E9.5 <italic>Hex </italic>null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. To examine whether the ventral pancreatic defects observed in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos are a consequence of a similar mechanism, we examined the development of the ventral foregut endoderm at around the 6 somite stage. In <italic>Hex </italic>null embryos, the failure of the ventral foregut endoderm to proliferate is characterised by a dorsal ingression of the visceral extraembryonic endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Using HNF4&#x003b1; as a marker that specifically identifies the extraembrynoic visceral endoderm at this developmental stage, we found that the positioning of the visceral extraembryonic endoderm relative to the ventral foregut and cardiac mesoderm between <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>or <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos was indistinguishable. These data suggest that the failure of ventral pancreas specification in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos is via a mechanism distinct from that observed in <italic>Hex</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. This interpretation is supported by RT-PCR analysis of the ventral endoderm that shows comparable levels of <italic>Hex </italic>mRNA expression between <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/- </sup>and <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that GATA6 expression overlaps with GATA4 in the ventral foregut endoderm and that hepatic development is blocked in <italic>Gata6 </italic>null embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The identification of a ventral pancreatic phenotype in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos led us to examine whether pancreatic development was affected in <italic>Gata6 </italic>null embryos. As is the case for GATA4, loss of GATA6 results in embryonic lethality during gastrulation due to deficiencies in the development of the extraembryonic endoderm, which could be circumvented by generating embryos from <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>ES cells by tetraploid embryo complementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. At the 20 somite stage of development, <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>control embryos were found to express PDX1 in the ventral pancreas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, we were able to detect PDX1 positive cells in the ventral foregut. However, there appeared to be fewer of these cells in comparison to controls. Moreover, we also noted that the levels of PDX1 appeared to be lower in those PDX1 positive cells identified in <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos relative to controls, which robustly expressed PDX1. Together these results demonstrate that the development of the pancreatic epithelium is compromised by the loss of GATA6 but not as severely as that observed for loss of GATA4.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Development of the ventral pancreas is curtailed in <italic>Gata6</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos</bold>.

Studies on the transcriptional control of the <italic>Alb1 </italic>gene have implicated GATA transcription factors, and in particular GATA4, as being crucial during the early development of the liver. In the ventral foregut endoderm, GATA4, along with FOXA2, has been shown to bind to <italic>Alb1 </italic>transcriptional regulatory elements prior to the onset of hepatic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The ability of GATA4 and FOXA2 to alter chromatin structure has led to the hypothesis that these two proteins act to potentiate hepatic gene expression by preparing the promoters and enhancers of hepatic genes for the action of transcriptional activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. While our studies support a role for GATA4 and GATA6 during liver development, it is clear that the contribution of these two GATA factors is complex, with both factors acting dynamically at distinct stages of hepatic development and likely having both cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles.</p><p>The expression pattern of GATA4 points to a transient function for this gene during the earliest stages of hepatic development. This is compatible with GATA4 acting as a pioneer factor within the ventral endoderm during liver development. However, our finding that expression of liver genes is relatively unaffected in the hepatic endoderm between the 6&#x02013;12 somite stage and that formation of a pseudostratified epithelial bud can be detected in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos suggests that GATA4 is not essential for the onset of a hepatic developmental program. However, since both GATA4 and GATA6 are expressed in the ventral endoderm and both bind identical regulatory elements in target promoters, it seems reasonable to consider that the function of these two factors overlaps to facilitate the expression of liver genes during hepatic specification. GATA6 has been predicted to compensate for GATA4 function in a number of other studies, and <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Gata6</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mouse embryos arrest during midgestation stages of development due to cardiovascular defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Moreover, direct evidence supporting the proposal that GATA4 and GATA6 have functionally redundant roles during specification of the liver that are evolutionarily conserved come from studies in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Holtzinger and Evans have demonstrated that depletion of either zfGATA4 or zfGATA6 prevents expansion of the primary liver bud but does not block specification whereas depletion of both factors results in the absence of any detectable hepatic endoderm.</p><p>Although the specification of the hepatic lineage and initial formation of the liver bud appears relatively normal in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null mouse embryos, the liver bud fails to expand. Based on the observation that GATA4 is undetectable in the hepatic endoderm as it expands into the adjacent septum transversum mesenchyme, it appears unlikely that GATA4 has a cell autonomous role in this process in mammals. Tissue explant studies in chick and mouse have shown that an interaction with the septum transversum mesenchyme is crucial for the expansion of the liver bud, an effect that can be mediated by the growth factors BMP2 and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos, the absence of septum transversum mesenchyme adjacent to the liver bud would, therefore, be predicted to result in a failure in growth factor signalling necessary to drive expansion of the liver diverticulum. This in turn would imply that the failure of the <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>liver bud to expand reflects a secondary effect caused by the failure of the septum transversum mesenchyme to develop rather than a cell autonomous requirement for GATA4 within the hepatic endoderm.</p><p>The identification of defects in ventral pancreas development in <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>null embryos reveals roles for GATA factors in this tissue. Specification of the ventral pancreas, as defined by expression of <italic>Pdx1</italic>, can be detected at the 7&#x02013;8 somite stage in the ventral-most foregut endoderm. Specification of the ventral pancreas is dependent on the endoderm being positioned beyond the influence of FGF signals that originate from the cardiac mesoderm that specify the liver primordium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Examination of <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos at the 20 somite stage implied a complete absence of ventral pancreatic tissue that expresses PDX1. In <italic>Gata6 </italic>null embryos, although some PDX1 positive cells could be detected, their abundance was reduced. However, in contrast to the ventral pancreas, we were able to detect PDX1 and Hb9 in the dorsal pancreatic rudiment in <italic>Gata4 </italic>or <italic>Gata6 </italic>null embryos. This presumably reflects the fact that the tissue interactions and growth factor requirements necessary for development of the ventral pancreas are distinct from those of the dorsal pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>The absence of a ventral pancreas in <italic>Gata4 </italic>null embryos is similar to that of embryos that lack the transcription factor <italic>Hex </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In the absence of <italic>Hex</italic>, the morphology of the ventral foregut endoderm is compromised such that the subset of cells normally specified to become pancreas failed to extend beyond the inductive affect of the cardiac mesoderm. Consequently, the ventral pancreas was absent in these embryos as the ventral foregut endoderm followed an alternate fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, analyses of explant cultures of endoderm revealed that <italic>Hex</italic><sup>-/-</sup>foregut endoderm retained the capacity to express pancreatic genes demonstrating that the absence of the ventral pancreas was not cell autonomous. Although, like <italic>Hex</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos, loss of GATA4 prevents formation of the ventral pancreas, the mechanism seems to be distinct because in contrast to <italic>Hex</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos morphogenesis of the foregut appears to occur normally in <italic>Gata4</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryos. The possibility therefore exists that the GATA factors regulate ventral pancreatic development by potentiating pancreatic gene expression as has been proposed for the liver. This possibility is supported by a recent study showing that the <italic>Glucagon </italic>promoter can be directly activated by GATA4 in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although both GATA4 and GATA6 are expressed (data not shown) in the mesenchyme adjacent to the pancreatic endoderm and could, therefore, have cell non-autonomous roles during pancreatic development, studies using transgenic mouse embryos are consistent with a requirement for the GATA factors in the endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Decker <italic>et al </italic>generated transgenic mouse embryos that expressed GATA4 and GATA6 proteins fused to the Engrailed repressor domain within the developing pancreatic rudiments of transgenic mouse embryos using a <italic>Pdx1 </italic>promoter. Although the mechanism of action of GATA-Engrailed fusion proteins is likely to be complex, examination of five independent E17.5 GATA6-Engrailed transgenic embryos revealed that the pancreas was undetectable in three, while two displayed a severe disruption to pancreatic morphology. Similar expression of a GATA4-Engrailed fusion was less dramatic with one out of eight embryos displaying an abnormal pancreatic morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified GATA4 and GATA6 as key transcription factors that act to control the development of the hepatic and pancreatic lineages from the ventral foregut endoderm. A comparison of the expression profiles of these factors implies that these two factors have a complex functional relationship during this developmental regulation that likely involves both cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles. The precise cell type-specific contribution made by these factors during pancreatic and liver development of these tissues should be resolved by the endodermal or mesenchymal specific deletion of GATA4 and GATA6 by Cre-loxP technologies using available conditional alleles for <italic>Gata4 </italic>and <italic>Gata6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].
