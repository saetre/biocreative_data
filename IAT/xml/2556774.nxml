ATF3 expression was increased in the lungs of mice challenged with ovalbumin allergen, and this was associated with its recruitment to the promoters of genes encoding Th2-associated cytokines. ATF3-deficient mice developed significantly increased airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophilia, and enhanced chemokine and Th2 cytokine responses in lung tissue and in lung-derived CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes.

The worldwide prevalence, morbidity, and mortality of asthma have significantly increased over the last three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small airways that is characterized by mast cell, eosinophil, and mononuclear cell infiltration of the submucosa along with goblet cell hyperplasia. The inflammatory response in asthma is tightly associated with airway hyperresponsiveness to antigen-specific and nonspecific stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). In humans, and in a mouse model, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th2 cells play a crucial role in orchestrating airway inflammation by producing IL4, IL5, and IL13 and by regulating the production of IgE and the growth and differentiation of mast cells and eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Although the role of cytokines in the asthmatic response is relatively well understood, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of these mediators in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor (TF) NF-&#x003ba;B regulates many facets of the inflammatory response and also appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) to have a role in the pathogenesis of asthma. For example, activated NF-&#x003ba;B has been identified in the airways of patients with asthma, and agents that exacerbate asthma such as allergens, ozone, and viral infections also stimulate NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Furthermore, corticosteroids, the first-line treatment for asthma, are potent inhibitors of NF-&#x003ba;B activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Finally, mice that are null for the p50 or c-Rel subunits of NF-&#x003ba;B develop significantly less airway inflammation after allergen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We recently identified activating TF 3 (ATF3) as a potent negative regulator of the inflammatory response in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), where it antagonized NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;induced responses. ATF3 is a member of the CREB family of BZip (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Its role in dampening inflammation and its capacity to antagonize NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;induced responses prompted us to examine its role in a mouse model of human asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>ATF3 is induced in a mouse asthma model</title><p>OVA sensitization and challenge led to a significant increase in ATF3 transcription in the lungs of WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), and this was paralleled by increased expression of the protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Immunohistochemical localization showed weak ATF3 staining in the epithelium of saline-treated WT mice. Upon treatment with ovalbumin (OVA), increased levels of ATF3 were seen in the inflammatory cell infiltrate, smooth muscle layer, and around blood vessels.

Lung resistance (R<sub>L</sub>), as a measure of airway hyperreactivity, was assessed using aerosolized methacholine and invasive plethysmography. Baseline airway resistance was not significantly different between WT and ATF3-null mice (WT-saline, 1.17 &#x000b1; 0.05; WT-OVA, 1.36 &#x000b1; 0.03; ATF3-saline, 1.00 &#x000b1; 0.24; and ATF3-OVA, 1.19 &#x000b1; 0.34). Airway resistance was significantly increased in the OVA-treated ATF3-null mice when compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The increased airway resistance in ATF3-null mice was accompanied by a fivefold increase in inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), whereas there was only a twofold increase in the cellular influx in WT BAL fluid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Differential counts showed a significantly higher number of macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the BAL fluid of ATF3-null mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Remarkably, there was a 4.7-fold increase in pulmonary eosinophils (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Histological analysis of lung tissue from OVA-treated WT mice showed an accumulation of eosinophils and mononuclear cells in the peribronchial and perivascular regions and edema of the airway interstitium compared with saline controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Each of these features was markedly increased in OVA-treated ATF3-null mice. Significantly, there was a dramatic increase in inflammatory cell infiltrate in the alveolar spaces of ATF3-null mice when compared with WT mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Airway mucus production, as determined by periodic acid-Schiff staining, was similar between WT and ATF3-null mice under baseline conditions.

These results indicate that IL4, IL5, and IL13 are direct binding targets of ATF3. Multiple AP1 and NFAT sites have been identified in the Th2 cytokine locus and these are thought to coordinate transcription. Our ChIP experiments demonstrated that Junb was recruited to a site in close apposition to the ATF3 binding site in the target promoters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>), whereas c-Fos, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2 were not (not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>In vivo ATF3 recruitment and histone acetylation in the Th2 cytokine locus.</bold> (A) ChIP analysis of ATF3 to predicted binding sites in the IL4, IL5, and IL13 promoters.

ATF3 may also be involved in this process, as we have previously shown ATF3-related HDAC1 binding and associated histone deacetylation at H3 and H4 residues. Such modifications, in the main, are involved with transcriptional inhibition. We thus investigated histone acetylation in the IL4, IL5, and IL13 promoters in WT and ATF3-null CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes. In these studies, naive CD4 cells were cultured under Th2 conditions and then processed for ChIP.

We recently demonstrated that ATF3 is a negative regulator of TLR4-induced inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), and we show in this paper that it significantly dampens the development of allergic airway inflammation. Our observations provide a clear link between severe asthmatic inflammation and airway disease with the defect in transcriptional control mediated by the TF ATF3.</p><p>ATF3 is activated in response to allergen challenge in the lungs of WT mice and contributes to the regulation of the Th2 cytokines IL4, IL5 and IL13, as well as many CCL chemokine genes that contribute significantly to immune cell influx into the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). These increased cytokine levels can account for some of the key effects on the asthma phenotype seen in these mice. IL13 induces differentiation of goblet cells and secretion of mucin in the airways of mice after allergen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). IL4 induces typical Th2 responses, including airway goblet cell metaplasia in a mouse asthma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). IL5 promotes growth and maturation of eosinophil precursors and stimulates chemotaxis of mature eosinophils, prolonging their survival in allergic inflammatory tissue sites by inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Similar levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 were induced in ATF3-null mice, indicating that they are competent in their ability to generate OVA-specific T cell responses and undergo Ig isotype switching, although this is not enhanced despite increased Th2 cytokine production. It has been previously shown that IL4, through the induction of the TF STAT6, directs the transactivation of the C&#x003b5; and C&#x003b3;1 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Thus, ATF3 is not absolutely required for IgE and IgG1 expression, nor does it appear to play a role in dampening IgE production. The diminished OVA-specific IgG2a in ATF3-null mice are interesting, as IFN-&#x003b3; regulation of the transcription factor TBX21 (T-bet) in B-lymphocytes controls IgG class switching to IgG2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). As IFN-&#x003b3; levels were undetectable in the BAL of ATF3-null mice (unpublished data), it is possible that the severe Th2 skewing in the ATF3-null animals accounts for this stark phenomenon. However, direct induction of T-bet transcription by ATF3 cannot be ruled out and will require further investigation.</p><p>We previously identified ATF3 as a component of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;containing transcriptional complexes in LPS-triggered macrophages. In this study, we show that ATF3 functions in AP-1&#x02013;containing complexes in Th2-skewed CD4 lymphocytes and that ATF3 binds to the Th2 cytokine promoters in close proximity to the AP-1 family TF, Junb. Junb has previously been shown to be necessary for the induction of IL4, IL5, and IL13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Previous work indicates that ATF3 can physically interact with many AP-1 family members including Junb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Thus, in Th2-skewed CD4 lymphocytes, ATF3 and Junb function in a feed-forward loop.</p><p>The selective allergen-induced production of Th2 cytokines and chemokines in association with diminished IFN-&#x003b3; production is a hallmark of the asthmatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Th2 skewing has been mechanistically linked to changes in chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Our previous observations demonstrating changes in chromatin structure after regulated binding of ATF3 and HDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>) suggest a possible mechanism for Th2 cytokine regulation by this TF.</p><p>The promoters of IL4 and IL13 share similar cis-regulatory elements within 500 bp of the transcription start site (TSS) that bind multiple TFs, particularly NFAT and AP-1 (Junb), which strongly synergize to induce transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). These NFAT/AP-1 regions are called P sites and act via cooperative binding to form a higher order transcriptional complex. We identified ATF3 recruitment to the essential P2 region of the IL4 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Importantly, Type I HDAC (HDAC1, 2, or 3) activity has been identified in this region of the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Therefore, ATF3-mediated HDAC1 recruitment and resulting effects on histone acetylation levels offer a mechanistic explanation for this observation. Significantly less is known about regulatory regions of the IL13 promoter, although the ATF3 binding site is also, amid P sites, closely opposed to the TSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). These similarities in promoter binding site architecture and histone regulation may lead to the shared expression kinetics of IL4 and IL13.</p><p>Transcriptional control of the IL5 promoter is less completely described. There are four cis elements necessary for full transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). The first of these, termed IL5A, is found &#x02212;940 bp from the TSS and is within &#x0223c;40 bp of the ATF3 binding site. This is the upstream enhancer region of IL5, and deletion of these sites inhibits transcription by &#x0223c;50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). As ATF3 can recruit HDAC activity to these sites, resulting in condensed chromatin and inhibited gene transcription, this may be a necessary regulatory switch in Th2 cytokine production.</p><p>A significant hallmark of asthma is accumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the lung, a process which is highly dependent on chemokines. This cellular influx is directly proportional to disease severity. Many cell types contribute to chemokine mRNA profiles seen in asthmatic lung tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). IL13 is known to induce chemokine expression, a mechanism that was only partly dependent on STAT6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Macrophages are significant producers of lung chemokines and can respond to IL13 through PPAR receptor signaling pathway, which may explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Conversely, ATF3 may play a direct regulatory role in controlling chemokine expression, as has been previously shown for RANTES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) and CCL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Like the Th2 cytokine locus, CCL and CXCL chemokines are also clustered on mouse chromosomes 11 and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Our data showing the enhanced up-regulation of these clustered CCL chemokines define a potential mechanism to explain the pronounced inflammatory cell infiltrate in ATF3-null mice leading to asthmatic exacerbation. Given the complex interplay between diverse cell types, signaling pathways, and cis-regulatory regions contributing to the exacerbated chemokine profiles seen in the lungs of ATF3-null mice, elucidation of this mechanism will require more in-depth and cell-specific examination.</p><p>In conclusion, ATF3-null mice generate a complete asthma-like phenotype, including airway inflammation, remodeling, and resulting hyperresponsiveness, and a lack of responsiveness from the ATF3 pathway confers susceptibility to severe allergic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Animals.</title><p>C57/Bl6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
