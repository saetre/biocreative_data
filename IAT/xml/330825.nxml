Starting with a single-stranded phagemid template, T4 DNA polymerase is used to extend an annealed primer. This leads to a fully double-stranded circular molecule with a nick or small gap just 5' to the primer. Exonuclease III initiates progressive digestion from the resulting 3' end. Removal of timed aliquots and digestion with a single-strand specific endonuclease leads to a series of linear nested fragments having a common end corresponding to the 5' end of the primer. These molecules are circularized and used to transform cells, providing large numbers of deletion clones with targeted breakpoints. The 6-step procedure involves successive additions to tubes, beginning with a single-stranded template and ending with transformation; no extractions, precipitations or centrifugations are needed. Results are comparable to those obtained with standard Exonuclease III-generated deletion protocols, but there is no requirement for restriction endonuclease digestion or for highly purified double-stranded DNA starting material. This procedure provides a strategy for obtaining nested deletions in either direction both for DNA sequencing and for functional analysis.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0115-a" xlink:role="2964"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0116-a" xlink:role="2965"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2961"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2962"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2963"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2964"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2965"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00194-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2966"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
