Here we report the determination of the crystal structure of Emg1 at 2 &#x000c5; resolution in complex with the methyl donor, <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). This structure identifies Emg1 as a novel member of the alpha/beta knot fold methyltransferase (SPOUT) superfamily. In addition to the conserved SPOUT core, Emg1 has two unique domains that form an extended surface, which we predict to be involved in binding of RNA substrates. A point mutation within a basic patch on this surface almost completely abolished RNA binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. Three point mutations designed to disrupt the interaction of Emg1 with SAM each caused&#x0003e;100-fold reduction in SAM binding <italic>in vitro</italic>. Expression of only Emg1 with these mutations could support growth and apparently normal ribosome biogenesis in strains genetically depleted of Emg1. We conclude that the catalytic activity of Emg1 is not essential and that the presence of the protein is both necessary and sufficient for ribosome biogenesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a highly complex process involving the coordinated action of more than 200 cofactors, including non-ribosomal proteins and small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). The ribosome itself consists of 79 ribosomal proteins and four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), of which 18S, 5.8S and 25S are processed in multiple steps from a single precursor transcribed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), whereas the 5S rRNA is independently transcribed by Pol III. Assembly of the ribosomal proteins onto the rRNA is coordinated with the pathway of maturation of the rRNAs, which involves multiple processing steps and numerous covalent nucleotide modifications. Most nucleotide modifications are the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine, mediated by box H/ACA snoRNPs and methylation of the 2&#x02032;-OH of ribose, directed by box C/D snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7">5&#x02013;7</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the modifications directed by snoRNPs, a small number of base modifications are generated by specific RNA methyltransferases (MTases). Dim1 is the best-studied rRNA MTase in yeast and is required for the dimethylation that forms a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="gkm1074i1.jpg"/></inline-formula>A doublet at the 3&#x02032;-end of the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Dim1 is essential for viability and for 18S rRNA synthesis in yeast. However, analyses of catalytically inactive mutants of Dim1 and mutation of the target site in the rRNA showed that dimethylation activity was not required for 18S rRNA synthesis. Lack of the modification did, however, inhibit 40S subunit function in translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The requirement for Dim1 in 18S synthesis was suggested to reflect the activity of a quality control mechanism that verifies the presence of the MTase to ensure the synthesis of fully functional ribosomes.</p><p>Emg1 (also called Nep1) is a 28-kDa protein conserved from Eukaryotes to Archaea, and is essential for cell growth in yeast. Expression of <italic>EMG1</italic> shows the environmental stress responsive pattern that is characteristic of many ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and Emg1 is associated with the SSU processome, a large complex required for the production of mature 18S RNA and biogenesis of the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Consistent with these observations, depletion of Emg1 inhibits pre-rRNA processing in the pathway of 18S rRNA synthesis. Two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that Emg1 interacts with Nop14, which is required for nuclear localization of Emg1. The nucleolar localization of Nop14 is dependent on Noc4 and the Nop14&#x02013;Noc4 complex is also required for biogenesis of the small ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Screens for suppressors of defects in <italic>EMG1</italic> have identified mutations in several genes encoding ribosome synthesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In particular, suppression was conferred by deletion of the gene encoding the box C/D snoRNA snR57, which is responsible for methylation of G<sub>1570</sub> in the 18S RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This suggested that either the loss of methylation at G<sub>1570</sub> or the absence of snR57 binding at this site could compensate for the absence of Emg1. Over-expression of the ribosomal protein Rps19 also partially compensated for the loss of function of Emg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), indicating that Emg1 may be involved in the recruitment and/or assembly of Rps19 on the pre-40S ribosome subunit. These observations correlate with evidence from a three-hybrid screen, showing that Emg1 interacts with an 18S rRNA sequence in a loop between helices 33 and 47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This region contains G<sub>1570</sub>, the target of snR57 methylation, and is in close proximity with the proposed Rps19-binding site. Finally, a multicopy suppressor screen identified <italic>SAM2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), which encodes <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) synthase. This suggested that the Emg1 mutation was suppressed by a high SAM concentration, and that Emg1 is involved in a methylation reaction. An extensive bioinformatical analysis of the alpha/beta knot fold MTase proteins, predicted Emg1 as a potential member of the SPOUT superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Here we present the crystal structure of Emg1, and report that the protein belongs to the alpha/beta knot fold MTase superfamily. Emg1 defines a new structural class in this superfamily as it contains the core structure characteristic for members of the superfamily, but also carries two extra domains that are conserved in Emg1 orthologs, but absent from other members of the superfamily. These contribute to an extended surface that we predict to be involved in binding of the RNA substrate. We further show that Emg1 displays robust SAM-binding activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but this activity is not required for ribosome biogenesis or growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant Emg1</title><p>The <italic>EMG1</italic> ORF was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain S288C as a template. An additional sequence coding for a 6-histidine tag was introduced at the 3&#x02032;-end of the ORF during amplification. The PCR product was then cloned into a derivative of pET9 vector. Expression was done at 37&#x000b0;C using the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Rosetta strain. The His-tagged protein was purified on a Ni&#x02013;NTA column (Qiagen Inc.) followed by gel filtration. Selenomethionine-substituted Emg1 was produced and purified as the native protein. For binding assays the <italic>EMG1</italic> ORF was cloned into a pQE80 (Qiagen) derivative for expression with an N-terminal His<sub>10</sub>-zz- or His<sub>10</sub>-tag. The protein was purified as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization of Emg1</title><p>Crystals of Emg1 were obtained from a 1:1 mixture of protein (10 mg/ml) with 25% PEG4K, 0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris pH7.5, 20% glycerol. Crystals were transferred to the precipitant solution with the glycerol concentration raised to 30% prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals belong to the P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit and diffracted to 2 &#x000c5; on the BM30A beamline at the ESRF, and to 2 &#x000c5; on the ID14-4 beamline for the SAM soaks. The phases were obtained by single anomalous dispersion collected on the Selenium peak. The Selenium sites were found using ShelX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and the phases were determined using Solve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Eighty percent of the protein was automatically rebuilt using Resolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and manually completed using TURBO and O. A few regions of the protein were not visible in the electron density, probably due to the structural disorder. Analysis of the B-factors shows that the two Emg1-specific subdomains are less well ordered than the rest of the protein. The structural disorder is visible in the poorly defined &#x003b2;c&#x02032;&#x02013;&#x003b2;d&#x02032; loop and the missing eight residues in the &#x003b2;a&#x02032;, &#x003b2;b&#x02032; loop.

The &#x003b2;3 strand, which extends the &#x003b2;-sheet after &#x003b2;2, is found in most members of the superfamily but Emg1 is the only case where this strand is antiparallel to &#x003b2;2. This can be attributed to the fact that the &#x003b1;B helix inserted between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3 is absent in Emg1, and replaced by a short hairpin loop in order to make room for the Emg1-specific insertions.

In these cases, dimerization always involves the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;E helical side of the protein, but the orientation of the two monomers varies. Dimerization provides an extended surface for RNA binding and completes the catalytic site, with the catalytic residue being provided by the opposing monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). As the crystal structure did not provide evidence for a similar dimeric form for Emg1, dimerization was analyzed by binding experiments and gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). Two Emg1 fusion constructs were expressed separately; a fusion of Emg1 with two copies of the Z-domain of protein A and His<sub>10</sub> (Hzz-Emg1) and a fusion with Emg1 only a His<sub>10</sub>-tag (His-Emg1). The two constructs were mixed and incubated together, and the Hzz-Emg1 was then specifically retrieved on IgG Sepharose.

For several proteins, the location of the SAM-binding site was determined by co-crystallization with either SAM or SAH. In all solved complexes, the SAM molecule binds in the knotted region [for example, YibK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and TrmD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>)]. The particular structure of the knot is at the center of the catalytic site of the enzyme and therefore necessary for its function.</p><p>Superposition of Emg1 on the structure of knotted MTase proteins in complex with SAH or SAM revealed that Emg1 contains an appropriate cavity to accommodate the methyl-donor. We confirmed that Emg1 binds SAM at this site by binding experiments (see below) and by soaking Emg1 crystals in mother liquor containing 2 mM SAM and solving the structure of the Emg1/SAM binary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The residual electron density unambiguously showed the presence of SAM in the expected pocket. The SAM-binding site in Emg1 is located in the knotted region and is composed of residues from the &#x003b2;4-&#x003b1;d&#x02032;, &#x003b2;5-&#x003b2;6 and &#x003b2;6-&#x003b1;E loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The adenine base is deeply buried in a cavity lined with hydrophobic residues. The ceiling of the cavity is closed by stacking interactions between Phe182 from the &#x003b2;4-&#x003b1;d&#x02032; loop and Pro231 from the &#x003b2;6-&#x003b1;E loop. The transferred methyl group of SAM is oriented towards the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;E face. Comparison of Apo Emg1 and SAM-bound Emg1 showed only limited structural rearrangements; a slight movement of the &#x003b2;5&#x02013;&#x003b2;6 loop and a 180&#x000b0; reorientation of the Asp214 side chain which swings around to form a hydrogen bond with the 3&#x02032;O of the SAM ribose moiety and a salt bridge with the nitrogen of the SAM methionine moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Although Asp214 is conserved in fungal Emg1 homologs, it is absent in mammals and Archaea. Six other hydrogen bonds are formed with the SAM moiety, all involving backbone atoms of Gly207, Gly212, Leu232, Ser228 and Tyr230. All of these residues are conserved in Eukaryotes and the glycines are also conserved in Archaea.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutations in the catalytic site of Emg1 abolish SAM binding</title><p>Based on the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), residues around the predicted catalytic site were selected to generate Emg1 mutants that are defective in the binding of SAM. As the SAM-binding pocket is largely lined by hydrophobic residues, single mutations were chosen that introduce longer side chains which protrude into the cavity or bring in charges. All hydrogen bonds to SAM are formed with the peptide backbone, with the exception of Asp214 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), which was mutated to arginine for charge inversion. The mutations analyzed were D214R, L232D, L232S, A237D and A237R.

The alpha/beta knot fold in SCOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) currently encompasses five families: (i) The YbeA-like family (pdb code 1ns5), with four uncharacterized members, which do not contain any specific additions to the core fold. (ii) The TrmD tRNA (m1G37)-MTases methylate the N1 position of guanine in tRNA. Their fold is similar to the YbeA-like family but contains an all-alpha C-terminal subdomain. (iii) The SpoU-like RNA 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic> ribose MTase family contains both tRNA (TrmH) and rRNA (RlmB) MTases, which methylate the ribose 2&#x02032;-OH of guanosine at specific positions of tRNA or rRNA, respectively. RlmB contains an N-terminal domain with analogy to the L30 ribosomal protein linked to the catalytic subunit by a flexible linker. (iv) The archaeal <italic>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</italic> MT1 protein family, which is unique due to the insertion of an OB fold subdomain between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;3. (v) The YggJ-like family that contains a N-terminal L5 ribosomal like domain. The core of Emg1 could be superimposed well with the core region of all members of the alpha/beta knot fold MTase superfamily. However, the Emg1 structure shows insertions that make it clearly distinct from each of these families. We therefore confirmed the prediction that Emg1 is the founding member of an additional alpha/beta knot fold MTase subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>The Emg1-specific insertions consist of two subdomains that form an extended surface on one side of the protein. This contributes to a basic patch around the active site, which is very likely involved in substrate rRNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), and Emg1 was indeed shown to bind RNA directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Mutation of Arginine 88 (R88D), which is located within the basic patch, almost completely abolishes the interaction with the RNA, supporting the proposed function of this region in substrate binding. This conclusion is further supported by the finding of two sulfate ions in the structure that could mimic phosphates of the RNA backbone. The two sulfates are bound to the protein by salt bridges to Lys135/Arg136 and Arg136/Arg129. These three residues are located on the Emg1-specific region, &#x003b1;c&#x02032; helix and &#x003b1;c&#x02032;-&#x003b2;3 loop and Arg136/Arg129 are absolutely conserved in both Eukaryotes and Archaea. This strongly suggests that this extended Emg1-specific region is also involved in RNA binding.</p><p>The results from the RNA-binding experiments are consistent with the findings of Buchhaupt <italic>et al.</italic> (2006), where a modified yeast three-hybrid approach was performed to identify a sequence derived from the 18S rRNA that was bound by Emg1 with high affinity. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses showed that Emg1 binds to this 18S sequence more strongly than an RNA of unrelated sequence. However, <italic>in vitro</italic> binding was clearly not highly specific.</p><p>There is a striking difference between the sequence conservation of Emg1 in Eukaryotes (on average 50% identical) versus that in Archaea (on average 30% identical) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The alignment suggests that the archaeal and eukaryotic Emg1 orthologs have the same characteristic fold but constitute two separate families, which might indicate that Emg1 has overlapping but not identical functions in both kingdoms of life. Surface residues conserved between Eukaryotes and Archaea cluster on one side of the protein: the SAM-binding site, the region immediately proximate to the methyl donor, the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;E face of the protein and the Emg1-specific extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, left panel). In contrast, residues on the opposite side of the protein (Helix HC side, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C right panel) are much less conserved between Eukaryotes and Archaea. While the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;E conserved face of Emg1 is likely involved in dimerization and/or substrate binding, the opposite, less conserved face, may interact with additional factors that are not conserved between Eukaryotes and Archaea. A candidate for such a factor could be Nop14, which binds to Emg1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) but has no clear archaeal homolog.</p><p>A feature shared between all previously characterized members of the alpha/beta knot MTase families is the presence of dimers in the crystal forms, and some members were confirmed to form dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The detailed dimerization mode varies, but always involves the &#x003b1;A and &#x003b1;E helical surface of the protein. Moreover, mutants of the SpoU family protein Yibk, engineered to be monomeric rather than dimeric, were unable to bind SAH, suggesting that dimerization is required for structure and function of alpha-beta knot MTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In contrast, Emg1 crystallized as a monomer, possibly due to differences in the dimerization interface, the composition of the active site or disruption of the dimer by the crystallization liquor. Stable dimerization was, however, confirmed for Emg1 in solution, both by gel filtration and binding experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Based on the structure of the SAM-binding region of Emg1, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to obtain mutants defective in SAM binding. All mutants analyzed were found to be defective in binding SAM <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), confirming predictions based on the structural data. The almost complete loss of affinity for SAM, the MTase cofactor, strongly indicates that these mutants have lost the capacity to perform a MTase reaction.</p><p>Emg1 is essential for viability in yeast, and we assessed whether the essential function requires its MTase activity or RNA binding. Three <italic>emg1</italic> mutants that had lost SAM binding as well as the R88D mutant that lacks RNA-binding activity were able to fully complement the growth defect seen upon depletion of endogenous Emg1, suggesting that the presence of the catalytically inactive protein was sufficient to support growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Analysis of ribosome biogenesis in the SAM-binding mutants revealed that expression of only the inactive forms of Emg1 also supported normal pre-rRNA processing and ribosome synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We conclude that the putative SAM-dependant MTase activity of Emg1 is not required for ribosome biogenesis or growth in yeast.</p><p>Similar results were previously obtained for the MTase Dim1 and for methylation guide snoRNPs. Dim1 dimethylates two adjacent adenosine residues in the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Analyses of Dim1 showed that, as for Emg1, the presence of catalytically inactive protein was sufficient for ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This leads to two possible interpretations. Both MTases may play structural roles in the pre-ribosome that are distinct from their enzymatic activities. Alternatively, or in addition, quality control mechanisms may have evolved to check for the presence of the protein rather than for the successful modification of the rRNA. Methylation guide snoRNPs carry out 2&#x02032;-OH methylation at several sites on the rRNA. Strains lacking the activity of any individual methylation guide snoRNA were also viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), whereas loss of the activity of the snoRNA-associated MTase Nop1, was lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). These data reveal that loss of rRNA methylation at any single site tested has little effect on ribosome biogenesis or function in yeast, whereas loss of methylation at multiple sites impairs ribosome synthesis and/or translation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank P.
