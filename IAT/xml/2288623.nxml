Correction for within-person variability was made using data from repeat measurements taken several years apart in several hundred participants. The year-to-year variability of IL-6 values within individuals was relatively high (regression dilution ratios of 0.41, 95&#x00025; confidence interval &#x0005b;CI&#x0005d; 0.28&#x02013;0.53, over 4 y, and 0.35, 95&#x00025; CI 0.23&#x02013;0.48, over 12 y). Ignoring this variability, we found an odds ratio for CHD, adjusted for several established risk factors, of 1.46 (95&#x00025; CI 1.29&#x02013;1.65) per 2 standard deviation (SD) increase of baseline IL-6 values, similar to that for baseline C-reactive protein. After correction for within-person variability, the odds ratio for CHD was 2.14 (95&#x00025; CI 1.45&#x02013;3.15) with long-term average (&#x0201c;usual&#x0201d;) IL-6, similar to those for some established risk factors. Increasing IL-6 levels were associated with progressively increasing CHD risk. An updated systematic review of electronic databases and other sources identified 15 relevant previous population-based prospective studies of IL-6 and clinical coronary outcomes (i.e., MI or coronary death). Including the two current studies, the 17 available prospective studies gave a combined odds ratio of 1.61 (95&#x00025; CI 1.42&#x02013;1.83) per 2 SD increase in baseline IL-6 (corresponding to an odds ratio of 3.34 &#x0005b;95&#x00025; CI 2.45&#x02013;4.56&#x0005d; per 2 SD increase in usual &#x0005b;long-term average&#x0005d; IL-6 levels).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk about as strongly as are some major established risk factors, but causality remains uncertain.

With age, &#x0201c;atherosclerotic plaques&#x0201d;&#x02014;deposits of fats, calcium, and various cellular waste products&#x02014;coat the walls of arteries, causing them to narrow and harden, interrupting blood flow through the body. When this occurs in the coronary arteries, which nourish the heart muscle, the end result is CHD. If a plaque breaks off the artery wall, it can get trapped in the arteries and completely stop the blood flow, causing death of the heart muscle. The technical term for this is &#x0201c;myocardial infarction&#x0201d; (MI), although it is more commonly known as a heart attack. Smoking, high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol (a type of fat), being overweight, and being physically inactive all increase the risk of developing CHD, as do some inherited factors. Treatments for CHD include lifestyle changes (for example, losing weight and exercising regularly) and medications that lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol. In the worst cases, the narrowed artery can be widened using a device called a stent or surgically bypassed.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Atherosclerosis might, at least partly, be an inflammatory condition. Inflammation&#x02014;an immune response to injury characterized by swelling and redness&#x02014;involves the production of proteins called &#x0201c;cytokines,&#x0201d; which attract cells of the immune system to the site of injury. In atherosclerosis, damage to the artery walls seems to trigger inflammation, which helps the atherosclerotic plaques grow. Because of the potential involvement of inflammation in atherosclerosis, increased levels of circulating cytokines might be associated with an increased risk of CHD. If they are, cytokines might provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of CHD. In this study, the researchers have asked whether prolonged moderate increases in the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the bloodstream are associated with CHD risk. IL-6, which is produced very early in inflammation, survives only briefly in the human body and its levels fluctuate within individuals. Consequently, its relevance to CHD has been unclear in previous studies.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>Between 1967 and 1991, nearly 25,000 healthy, mainly middle-aged people were enrolled into two studies&#x02014;the Reykjavik Study and the British Regional Heart Study&#x02014;and followed for about 20 years, during which time 2,138 people had a first-ever nonfatal heart attack or died of CHD. The researchers measured baseline IL-6 blood levels in these participants and in 4,267 similar participants who had not had a CHD event. They also measured IL-6 levels in 558 healthy participants several years into the study to determine a &#x0201c;regression dilution ratio&#x0201d; for IL-6. This ratio gives an idea of the year-to-year consistency of IL-6 levels. When the researchers used this ratio to estimate the impact of prolonged increases in IL-6 levels on CHD, they found that increased long-term IL-6 levels more than doubled the risk for CHD in their study populations. The researchers then combined these new results with those of 15 previous relevant studies. This combined analysis indicated very similar findings to those in the new data.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate prolonged moderate increases in IL-6 levels are associated with risk of CHD as strongly as several major established risk factors, including blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels, but whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship remains unknown. More studies are needed to find out whether this result is generalisable to other populations, but the broad agreement between the Icelandic and British studies suggests that they should be. This study renews interest in IL-6&#x02013;mediated inflammatory pathways and CHD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050078">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050078</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Read a related <italic>PLoS Medicine</italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050084">Perspective</ext-link> article</p></list-item><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007115.htm">coronary heart disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000171.htm">atherosclerosis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Cad/CAD_WhatIs.html">coronary heart disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/Atherosclerosis/Atherosclerosis_WhatIs.html">atherosclerosis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Information for patients and caregivers is provided by the American Heart Association on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1200000">all aspects of heart disease</ext-link>, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4648">inflammation and heart disease</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the British Heart Foundation on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/default.aspx">heart disease</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/keeping_your_heart_healthy/default.aspx">keeping the heart healthy</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Further details are available about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hjartarannsokn.is/index.aspx?GroupId=406">Reykjavik Study</ext-link> and the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/pcps/research/brhs/index.htm">British Regional Heart Study</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation">inflammation</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6">interleukin-6</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Danesh J, Kaptoge S, Mann AG, Sarwar N, Wood A, et al.

Inflammatory cascades are propagated by proximal mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine produced in various tissues. IL-6 exerts proinflammatory effects including stimulation of the liver to produce positive acute-phase proteins during tissue injury or infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Previous epidemiological studies of coronary heart disease (CHD) and inflammation have focused mainly on &#x0201c;downstream&#x0201d; acute phase reactants (e.g., fibrinogen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and C-reactive protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;) because they are comparatively stable within individuals over time. By contrast, investigation of IL-6 in CHD has been relatively limited because of its shorter half-life (&#x0003c;2 h) and greater within-person variability. Published prospective studies of IL-6 have yielded divergent odds ratios ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. However, as each report has typically comprised only a few hundred patients with CHD, the estimates involve wide, overlapping confidence intervals (CIs). A recent nonquantitative review &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; reported on published data from five prospective studies of IL-6 and CHD, but it comprised only about one-third of the currently published evidence, and it mixed results of studies involving different vascular outcomes and of different study designs. Even a more comprehensive and consistent review of published reports would not, however, have been able to assess appropriately IL-6&#x02013;CHD associations, because no individual prospective study to our knowledge has yet made allowances for the cytokine's within-person variability. Owing to fluctuations in IL-6 values over time, comparisons using only baseline values may yield biased estimates of the true association, which can be corrected, for the most part, by using data from paired measurements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="st2">Methods</xref>).</p><p>We report new data on IL-6 levels from two population-based prospective cohorts, the Reykjavik Study and the British Regional Heart Study (BRHS), which together comprise 24,230 predominantly middle-aged individuals with an average of almost 20 years of follow-up per participant. After exclusion of participants with any evidence of baseline coronary disease or stroke, 2,138 incident cases of CHD were available for the present analyses, more than four times as many CHD cases as in the largest previous study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Paired measurements were made in random samples of participants in both studies in order to quantify (and correct for) long-term variation in IL-6 levels. We contextualised our new data by conducting an updated systematic review of all prospective studies of IL-6 and CHD based only in essentially general populations, comprising a further 3,592 CHD cases (defined as myocardial infarction &#x0005b;MI&#x0005d; or death attributed to CHD by World Health Organization &#x0005b;WHO&#x0005d; or similar criteria). Furthermore, we used new data from serial measurements made in our two prospective studies to correct for within-person variability in the studies included in the meta-analysis. The focus of the current report is on the magnitude of the association of IL-6 levels with CHD (rather than on the separate issue of risk prediction).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>The Reykjavik Study and the BRHS were initiated in 1967 and 1978, respectively, and have each been described in detail previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In the Reykjavik Study, men and women born between 1907 and 1935, resident in Reykjavik, Iceland, and its adjacent communities on December 1, 1966, were identified in the national population register and were invited to participate in the study during five stages of recruitment between 1967 and 1991. A total of 8,888 male and 9,681 female participants aged 33&#x02013;86 y without a history of MI were recruited (72&#x00025; response rate). Nurses administered questionnaires, made physical measurements, recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG), performed spirometry, and collected fasting venous blood samples to prepare serum that was stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. History of diabetes was self-reported. All participants have been monitored subsequently for cause-specific mortality (ascertained from central registers on the basis of a death certificate; ICD-9 codes 410&#x02013;414 were used for CHD death) and for cardiovascular morbidity (diagnosis of MI was based on MONICA criteria), with a loss to follow-up of only about 0.6&#x00025; to date. The BRHS enrolled 7,735 men aged 40&#x02013;59 y (response rate 78&#x00025;) randomly selected from general practice registers in each of 24 British towns during 1978&#x02013;1980. Nurses administered questionnaires, made physical measurements, recorded an ECG, performed spirometry, and collected nonfasting venous blood samples from 5,661 men in 18 of the towns. Serum was obtained from the baseline blood samples and stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for subsequent analysis. Participants were monitored for all-cause mortality (ascertained through the National Health Service central registers, using ICD-9 codes 410&#x02013;414 for CHD) and for cardiovascular morbidity (using general practitioners' reports and records, with diagnosis of MI based on WHO criteria), with a loss to follow-up of less than 1&#x00025; to date. History of diabetes was, again, self-reported. Relevant institutional review boards approved each study, and participants provided informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Laboratory Measurements</title><p>IL-6 measurements were made in the Reykjavik Study and BRHS on available serum samples, using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R &#x00026; D Systems) in the Glasgow laboratory by the same technicians blinded to participants' disease status. The intra-assay coefficient of variability was 7&#x00025;, and the inter-assay coefficient of variability was 8&#x00025;. Measurements were made in pairs of samples from a randomly selected subset of baseline participants in each study, comprising 258 participants in the BRHS (samples collected at a median interval of about 4 y apart) and 300 participants in the Reykjavik Study (samples collected at a median interval of about 12 y apart). Because the temperature of storage of the initial BRHS samples was &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C, whereas it was &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C at the resurvey, there was scope in this study for slight overestimation of within-person variability in IL-6 levels, encouraging comparison of its findings with those from the Reykjavik Study in which conditions at the two surveys were identical. Lipid and other biochemical measurements involved standard assays, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>In both the Reykjavik Study and BRHS, two or three control participants were randomly selected and frequency matched to incident CHD cases in 5-y age bands (and, in the Reykjavik Study, on calendar year of recruitment and sex; and in the all-male BRHS by town of residence), thereby obtaining the same joint frequency distributions of these factors among controls and cases. To limit any biases due to preexisting disease, prespecified principal analyses were restricted to the 2,138 individuals with CHD and 4,267 control participants who did not have baseline evidence of CHD or stroke (i.e., without baseline ECG abnormalities or self-reported prevalent MI, stroke, or angina) in a nested case&#x02013;control comparison. Subsidiary analyses excluded patients who had CHD outcomes in the first 5 y of follow-up. Odds ratios for CHD per 2 standard deviations (SDs) increase in the natural logarithm (log<sub>e</sub>) of IL-6 were calculated using unconditional logistic regression (Stata, version 9). The odds ratios for a 2 SD change is similar to a comparison of extreme thirds of IL-6 values in a population. Analyses to investigate the shape of the IL-6&#x02013;CHD association were conducted for groups defined by fifths of baseline IL-6 values in controls, with corresponding 95&#x00025; CIs estimated from floating variances that reflect the amount of information underlying each group (including the reference group) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

Adjusted regression dilution ratios were calculated by Rosner's regression method &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; to quantify the extent to which single measurements of the markers reflect their long term average (i.e., &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d;) levels. Paired measurements from the BRHS were used solely for comparison.

The data also underscore the need for investigations of proximal inflammatory mediators that can quantify and correct for within-person variability. Serious underestimation is likely without such correction because, as demonstrated in the current study, the variability in IL-6 levels is substantially higher than for downstream inflammatory markers and several established CHD risk factors. Hence, given the central role of IL-6 levels in inflammatory pathways and its continuous association with CHD risk, it warrants further investigation as a plausible potential therapeutic target.

Both the Reykjavik Study and BRHS identified participants in population registers, involved high response and follow-up rates, and involved robust ascertainment of incident MI and coronary death. Their broadly similar results support the generalisability of the current findings. Assay methods used in the current study were similar to those in earlier reports, yielding similar median IL-6 levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0050078-t004">Table 4</xref>). Although the current studies involved more prolonged blood storage than previous studies, they produced associations with CHD risk at least as strong as in earlier studies, arguing against underestimation due to sample degradation. Paired IL-6 (and other) measurements enabled approximate correction for within-person variability in a way that implies that long-term average IL-6 values are relevant to CHD risk, consistent with prevailing hypotheses of sustained low-grade inflammation, but it is not clear why mean log<sub>e</sub> IL-6 levels were generally higher at resurvey examinations.</p><p>In comparison with a previous nonquantitative review &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, the current meta-analysis involved almost five times as many incident CHD cases from population-based prospective studies (thereby enhancing statistical power), strictly defined CHD as MI or fatal CHD (thereby enhancing accuracy of disease classification), excluded (where possible) people with prevalent cardiovascular disease (thereby limiting potential biases), and explored in detail potential sources of heterogeneity (thereby probing possible causes of study diversity). This updated review suggests that the apparently divergent estimates reported in earlier studies were probably chiefly due to random error. Further studies are needed to test whether associations of IL-6 with CHD are importantly modified by lipid concentrations, as suggested by exploratory analyses in the current report. Studies are also needed with serial measurements in larger numbers of participants over different intervals in order to assess IL-6 variability in greater detail (e.g., assessment of any changes in mean levels and variability over time). This information will enable study-specific and time-dependent correction for regression dilution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050078-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas in the current meta-analysis the correction factor was derived from repeat measurements in only the Reykjavik Study. Adjustment for within-person variability in both exposure and confounder levels across all available studies will require access to individual participant data, as demonstrated by such adjustment in the current analyses of the Reykjavik Study and BRHS.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Long-term IL-6 levels are associated with CHD risk about as strongly as are some major established risk factors, but causality remains uncertain.
