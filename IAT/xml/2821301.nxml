Notch encodes a transmembrane receptor, which, upon ligand binding, undergoes proteolytic processing and releases an intracellular fragment capable of acting as a transcription co-regulator. As both Notch and its ligands (also transmembrane proteins) are widely expressed, their activities need to be tightly regulated. One such important regulation appears to be ligand internalization, which plays a critical role in activating Notch receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Notch ligand internalization utilizes an ubiquitin-dependent endocytic pathway, as two structurally unrelated E3 ubiquitin ligases, <italic>neuralized (neur) </italic>and <italic>mind bomb (dMib)</italic>, can append ubiquitin to DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lag2) ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Epsin/<italic>lqf (liquid facets) </italic>then recruits the ubiquitinated DSL ligands into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The scission of these ligand-containing CCVs from the plasma membrane seems critical for Notch activation, as disruption of dynamin function also causes a <italic>Notch</italic>-like defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Another relevant factor in <italic>Drosophila </italic>Notch ligand endocytosis is the J-domain protein auxilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. First identified in mammals, auxilin is known to cooperate with Hsc70 in mediating the disassembly of clathrin triskelia and coat proteins from newly formed CCVs <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The mammalian genomes contain two distinct auxilin-related genes: <italic>auxilin </italic>and <italic>GAK</italic>, differing in the presence of an Ark (<bold>a</bold>ctin-<bold>r</bold>elated <bold>k</bold>inase) family kinase domain and their tissue distributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. GAK contains the Ark domain at the N-terminus and it is ubiquitously expressed. In contrast, auxilin lacks the kinase domain and its expression appears to be neuronal. However, the expression of auxilin in non-neuronal cells has recently been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Besides uncoating, several other functions during endocytosis have recently been suggested for auxilin family proteins, including facilitating clathrin exchange during coated-pit formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], participating in pit constriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and preventing precipitous assembly of clathrin cages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, GAK has been implicated in clathrin-mediated trafficking from the trans Golgi network (TGN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>While it is unclear which of the aforementioned cellular functions are most relevant under physiological conditions, mutations in the sole <italic>Drosophila </italic>auxilin ortholog (<italic>dAux</italic>) clearly disrupt several Notch-dependent processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One such process is the patterning of neural tissues, in which the cells destined to become neurons send a Notch-mediated signal to prevent neighboring cells from adopting neuronal fate. In the absence of this lateral inhibition, supernumerary neuronal cells are generated, forming the so-called neurogenic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Consistent with the notion that <italic>dAux </italic>participates in Notch signaling, excessive neurons were seen in both the embryonic CNS and the larval eye discs of <italic>dAux </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Mosaic analysis showed that the function of dAux during Notch signaling is required in the signal-sending cells, suggesting that it has a role in ligand internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Given the high degree of conservation of the Notch pathway, it seems reasonable to expect an inhibition of auxilin function in other animal systems would cause <italic>Notch</italic>-like defects. However, as multiple distinct endocytic pathways exist in higher metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it is possible that different endocytic pathways can functionally substitute for one another in Notch ligand endocytosis. Inhibition of auxilin function by RNA interference in <italic>C. elegans </italic>was shown to disrupt the receptor-mediated uptake of yolk proteins, yet no Notch-related defects were reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. RNAi-mediated reduction of GAK function in mammalian cells appeared to deregulate EGF signaling and promote tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Tissue-specific inactivation of mouse <italic>GAK </italic>during embryonic development caused severe degenerations in brain, liver, and skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], but it is unclear whether any of these defects were due to a disruption of Notch function. Thus, while it seems clear that auxilin family proteins are important for animal viability, whether their function in Notch ligand endocytosis is evolutionarily conserved requires additional investigations.</p><p>We have used zebrafish to further assess the roles of auxilin-dependent endocytosis in animal development. Besides being a versatile model organism, zebrafish is suitable for our purpose because the importance of Notch ligand endocytosis has been demonstrated during embryonic neural patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We show that zebrafish, like mammals but unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic>, contains both <italic>auxilin </italic>and <italic>GAK</italic>. Zebrafish <italic>auxilin </italic>and <italic>GAK </italic>are interchangeable in their abilities to substitute for <italic>dAux </italic>during <italic>Drosophila </italic>Notch signaling, suggesting that they share some cellular functions. However, they have different expression patterns during development, suggesting that these two paralogs are not completely redundant. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of <italic>GAK </italic>function during embryogenesis caused an increase in the formation of neuronal cells and a decrease in the expression of a Notch target gene, supporting our hypothesis that the role of auxilin family proteins in Notch signaling is conserved. Furthermore, we showed that embryos deficient in GAK function had a higher level of programmed cell death in neural tissues, suggesting that GAK is required for the survival of neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The zebrafish genome contains both <italic>GAK </italic>and <italic>auxilin</italic></title><p>To examine the roles of auxilin-related genes during vertebrate development, we first sought to identify <italic>auxilin </italic>or <italic>GAK </italic>in zebrafish genome.

This presence of two distinct auxilin-related orthologs appears to be a feature shared by other vertebrates, as the chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, XP_424873 and XP_422527) and pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>, CAG08624 and CAG11595) genomes both contain <italic>GAK </italic>and <italic>auxilin</italic>.

Alignment of protein sequences shows that zGAK is 65% identical to human GAK overall, with the sequence conservations concentrated in the kinase, PTEN and the J-domain. The kinase, PTEN and J-domain of zGAK are 82.4%, 84.7%, and 78.8% identical to the corresponding domains of human GAK respectively. In contrast, the CBM domains of zGAK and human GAK are more divergent, sharing only 31.7% amino acid sequence identity.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The genomic organizations and the protein sequences of zebrafish GAK and auxilin</bold>.

The corresponding cDNA contains a 3834 bp ORF, encoding a polypeptide of 1278 amino acids with an Ark kinase domain (blue), a PTEN-homologous region (orange), a clathrin-binding motif (CBM), and a J-domain (green). Two morpholinos, GAK-MO1 and GAK-MO2, (red boxes) were designed to disrupt the splicing of <italic>zGAK </italic>mRNA by blocking the splice acceptors of exon3 and exon19, respectively.

The protein sequence of zAux is 59.3% identical overall to the human auxilin. Again, the conservations are higher in the PTEN and the J-domain, as these domains share 67.5% and 94.5% amino acid identity respectively. These domains of zAux are also highly related to the PTEN and the J-domain of zGAK (50.8% and 89.4% protein sequence identity respectively), suggesting that <italic>zAux </italic>and <italic>zGAK </italic>are derived from a common ancestral gene. However, while zAux is similar to zGAK, it is more similar to human and mouse auxilin proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), suggesting that the divergence of GAK and auxilin occurred prior to the divergence of fish and mammals during vertebrate evolution.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>zGAK </italic>and <italic>zAux </italic>arose from gene duplication</bold>.

First, the human, mouse, and zebrafish <italic>GAK </italic>loci all contain an identical number (27) of introns. The <italic>zAux </italic>locus appears to have lost one intron in the CBM during evolution, as it contains 16 introns while the human and mouse auxilins have 17. Furthermore, in the conserved domains, the positions and the phases (0, 1, or 2 in the codons) of these introns can be precisely aligned. For example, the PTEN homologous regions of zebrafish, mouse, and human <italic>GAK </italic>and <italic>auxilin </italic>loci all contain 8 introns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These introns, although different in nucleotide lengths, are located at the same positions in the coding region with identical phases.

In untransfected cells, clathrin staining had a vesicular appearance throughout the cytosol, but it appeared depleted from these structures in those aggregate-containing cells. We noticed that zGAK seemed more capable of causing these aggregates than zAux, as intense GFP-positive and clathrin-containing structures were readily seen in cells expressing milder levels of GFP-zGAK.

Like their mammalian counterparts, zebrafish GAK and auxilin differ in the presence of the N-terminal kinase and their respective expression patterns. zGAK has a kinase domain and is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development. In contrast, the expression of <italic>zAux</italic>, the ortholog without the kinase domain, appears predominantly in the neuronal cells. There are other differences between the two at the protein sequence level. For instance, zGAK, but not zAux, contains a sequence of FGDL at the amino acid position 950, which matches perfectly to the consensus &#x003c8;G[PDE][&#x003c8;LM] (&#x003c8; is an aromatic residue). This motif, conserved in mammalian GAKs, has been shown to mediate interactions with AP1 adaptor in Golgi-lysosomal trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Taken together, these structural differences between GAK and auxilin suggest that their molecular functions may have diverged during evolution. It is notable that inhibiting <italic>zGAK </italic>function causes an increase in apoptotic cell death in the neuroectodermal tissues, where GAK and auxilin are both expressed. This inability of <italic>zAux </italic>to compensate for the <italic>zGAK </italic>knockdown would argue that GAK has a function unique from auxilin. However, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that these neural cells may have a higher demand for the functions of <italic>auxilin</italic>-related genes. In this scenario, the functions of both genes would be needed to prevent the onset of apoptosis; therefore, inhibiting GAK alone would be sufficient to induce extra neural cell deaths.</p><p>Despite the structural differences between GAK and auxilin, it seems clear that these two paralogs have overlapping molecular functions. Both GAK and auxilin are required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells, indicating that they act in the same process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Consistent with this, we showed that the subcellular localizations of zGAK or zAux in HeLa cells were similar, and over-expression of either in HeLa cells could form clathrin-containing aggregates. More importantly, we showed that over-expression of either zGAK or zAux in <italic>Drosophila </italic>could completely restore the neurogenic defects caused by <italic>dAux</italic>, and this ability to rescue <italic>dAux </italic>absolutely requires their respective J-domains. Together, these results suggest that zGAK and zAux are at least partially redundant.</p><p>Unlike zGAK or dAux, zAux does not have the N-terminal Ark kinase. Nevertheless, over-expression of zAux in <italic>Drosophila </italic>could completely restore the defects caused by a strong <italic>dAux </italic>allele. This is not entirely surprising as we have previous shown that over-expression of <italic>dAux</italic><sup>&#x00394;K</sup>, a <italic>dAux </italic>with its kinase domain deleted, could rescue the dAux phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In fact, over-expression of a fragment consisting of the CBM and J domains alone appears sufficient to restore the function of dAux in Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, the kinase domain does have a role in GAK's function in Notch as kinase domain-specific disruptions, by either point mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or morpholino-induced mis-splicing (MO1, this study), produce <italic>Notch</italic>-like phenotypes. Still, it does appear that, when expressed at a high level, the kinase activity is not required for the functions of auxilin family proteins.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, auxilin has been shown to participate in Notch signaling by facilitating ligand internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Given that mammals and vertebrates have two <italic>auxilin</italic>-related genes, it is not known if either, neither, or both function in the Notch pathway. The similarities in domain structures and expression patterns suggest that GAK is more likely to have a role in Notch. However, while inactivation of <italic>GAK </italic>affects the formation of multiple tissues in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], it was unclear whether these defects were caused by disrupted Notch signaling. Here we showed that, in <italic>GAK </italic>morphants, the number of <italic>HuC</italic>-positive cells appeared increased, a defect analogous to the neurogenic phenotype. Moreover, we showed that, in <italic>GAK </italic>morphants, the expression of <italic>Her4</italic>, a known Notch target gene, was reduced. Thus, while it is not yet known whether zGAK participates in ligand internalization, these defects in <italic>HuC </italic>and <italic>Her4 </italic>expressions suggest that GAK function is also required for Notch signaling in zebrafish. These results provide the first evidence that the requirement for a GAK-dependent endocytic pathway during Notch signaling is evolutionarily conserved. A requirement of the <italic>mindbomb </italic>E3 ligase and epsin in Notch has also been demonstrated in flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], which, along with our analysis of zebrafish GAK, suggests that Notch ligand internalization may rely on the same set of endocytic genes.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that a conditional removal of GAK function during mouse brain development causes a significant loss of neural tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], although the mechanism is not known. Likewise, our depletion of GAK function during zebrafish embryonic development results in neural-specific cell degeneration. Using TUNEL staining, we showed that this cell degeneration is caused by increased programmed cell death, suggesting that GAK has a role in preventing the apoptosis of neural cells. Thus, although more <italic>HuC</italic>-positive cells were present in <italic>zGAK</italic>-deficient embryos at the 8- and 10-somite stages, fewer <italic>HuC</italic>-positive cells might be expected at later stages because of cell death. Indeed, this was precisely what we observed, as fewer <italic>HuC</italic>-positive cells were seen in <italic>GAK </italic>morphants at 24 hpf. Interestingly, in <italic>mindbomb </italic>mutant embryos, where Notch ligand endocytosis is impaired, no cell degeneration phenotype was observed (J.S., unpublished data). This, along with our observation that <italic>Her4 </italic>expression was not significantly reduced at 24 hpf, suggests that the role of GAK in maintaining neural cell survival may be Notch-independent. Taken together, our results suggest that <italic>GAK </italic>has at least two distinct functions during the development of neural tissues: an early role in the patterning of neuronal cells and a later role in maintaining the survival of neuronal cells. Furthermore, human GAK has recently been implicated as a susceptibility gene in familial Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and the neurodegenerative phenotype observed in GAK morphants certainly supports this conclusion.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the phenotypes of the <italic>GAK </italic>morphants bear a strong resemblance to those of the <italic>"spacehead" </italic>class zebrafish mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. These mutants, isolated from a large-scale screen, are characterized by defects including cell degeneration in the eye and the brain regions, thinner yolk tube, and weak blood circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. As the genes responsible for most of these mutants have not been determined, the phenotypic similarities suggest that <italic>zGAK </italic>may correspond to one of them. If this is indeed the case, it will provide important clues to understand the functions of these genes in maintaining neuronal cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Zebrafish, like mammals but not invertebrates, has two distinct auxilin-related genes, auxilin and GAK. These two genes share some molecular functions, but are not completely redundant, as they are differentially expressed during development. Inhibition of GAK function appears to impair Notch signaling during embryonic neural patterning. This, along with the fact that auxilin has been implicated in <italic>Drosophila </italic>Notch signaling, suggests that the Notch pathway is regulated by a similar set of endocytic factors. In addition, we showed that inhibition of GAK function increases apoptosis in neural tissues, suggesting that GAK has a role in promoting or maintaining the survival of neural cells. As GAK is recently implicated in familial Parkinson disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], our results should provide a useful model for further understanding the cause of this neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Embryos and morpholino oligoneucleotides injections</title><p>All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee (PUCAC #06-111-09).
