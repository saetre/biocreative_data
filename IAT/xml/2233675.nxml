BRCA2 maintains genome stability in part through the regulation of Rad51-dependent homologous recombination. Much about its precise function in the DNA damage responses is, however, not yet known. We have made null mutations in the Drosophila homolog of <italic>BRCA2</italic> and measured the levels of homologous recombination, non-homologous end-joining, and single-strand annealing in the pre-meiotic germline of Drosophila males. We show that repair by homologous recombination is dramatically decreased in Drosophila <italic>brca2</italic> mutants. Instead, large flanking deletions are formed, and repair by the non-conservative single-strand annealing pathway predominates. We further show that during meiosis, Drosophila Brca2 has a dual role in the repair of meiotic double-stranded breaks and the efficient activation of the meiotic recombination checkpoint. The eggshell patterning defects that result from activation of the meiotic recombination checkpoint in other meiotic DNA repair mutants can be strongly suppressed by mutations in <italic>brca2</italic>.

A known function of BRCA2 is the repair of damaged DNA using the homologous recombination repair pathway. In the absence of BRCA2, damaged DNA is repaired by error-prone repair. However, as many other genes required for homologous recombination are not known breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA2 likely has additional roles in tumor suppression. In this study, we created fruit flies mutant for the homolog of <italic>BRCA2</italic>. We show that, like in humans, fruit fly Brca2 is required for DNA repair by homologous recombination. Additionally, we use this new animal model to discover a previously unknown role for Brca2 in the production of a signal that tells cells that damaged DNA is present during meiosis.

Genomic stability is maintained through robust DNA repair and checkpoint pathways that are tightly coordinated with each other and the developmental cell cycle progression of the organism. For example, mutations in meiotic DNA repair enzymes in Drosophila cause defects in the cell cycle and developmental progression of the egg due to a failure to repair meiotic recombination intermediates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The tumor suppressor and breast cancer susceptibility gene, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, has been implicated in playing a central role in maintaining genomic stability, but the extent to which BRCA2 is involved the coordination of DNA repair, checkpoints, and developmental progression remains to be determined.</p><p>Murine cells depleted for BRCA2 spontaneously accumulate broken chromosomes and chromatids, triradial and quadriradial structures, and gross chromosomal rearrangements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. A key function of BRCA2 is the regulation of the Rad51 recombinase during DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). During HR, Rad51 assembles into a nucleoprotein filament with single-stranded DNA at the site of a double-stranded break (DSB) in order to initiate strand invasion of the homologous chromosome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent structural studies have illuminated how BRCA2 regulates Rad51 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. BRCA2 contains two regions that mediate binding to Rad51: a stretch of 8 repeated short motifs termed the BRC repeats and a C-terminal region termed TR2. The BRC repeats bind the Rad51 oligermerization domain to disrupt Rad51 self-oligermerization. BRCA2 then catalyzes the formation of the nucleoprotein filament at the single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junction flanking a DSB. This filament is stabilized in a cell-cycle&#x02013;dependent manner by the TR2 domain of BRCA2. The role of BRCA2 in homologous recombination is likely critical for its role as a tumor suppressor, but BRCA2 is a large protein with many binding partners and it is likely to play multiple roles in safeguarding genomic stability.</p><p>Several requirements for BRCA2 outside of homologous recombination have been suggested by protein interaction and cell culture studies, but these functions are far less understood. Most notably, BRCA2 has been implicated in two S-phase checkpoints: the intra-S phase checkpoint and the replication checkpoint. During the intra-S phase checkpoint irradiation-induced lesions outside of the replication fork cause partial depression of replication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The replication checkpoint stabilizes replication forks and decreases replication levels in response to lesions at the replication fork. Requirements for BRCA2 in replication fork stabilization after hydroxyurea treatment and in suppressing radioresistant replication have also been described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The G1/S, S/M, and G2/M checkpoints have been found to be largely intact in <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutants.

Three major pathways known to repair DSBs are: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and single-strand annealing (SSA) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. In NHEJ, the DNA ends flanking the break are annealed, resulting in the insertion or deletion of several nucleotides at the site of the break. During SSA repair stretches of repetitive DNA flanking the DSB are annealed. Due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic chromosomes this pathway is likely available to some, but not all, naturally occurring DSBs. HR uses homologous sequences on the homologous chromosome or sister chromatid as a template for repair. If the sister chromatid is used, HR is non-mutagenic. However, if the homologous chromosome is the template, loss of heterozygosity can occur. BRCA2 in other species has been shown to be required for Rad51-dependent repair by homologous recombination and other roles in DNA repair have been suggested &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

The Rr3 assay monitors the repair of a DSB at an I-SceI endonuclease site flanked by partial copies of the reporter <italic>dsRed.</italic> There is a 147 base pair (bp) tandem duplication of <italic>dsRed</italic> flanking the break.

Repair by SSA recreates a functional copy of <italic>dsRed</italic> and the resulting flies are fluorescent red even in the absence of the endonuclease. Repair by NHEJ creates small insertions or deletions at the I-SceI site and the resulting flies are dark even in the presence of endonuclease.

Repair by HR using the sister chromatid (HR-s) recreates the reporter, which can be re-cut until a terminal outcome is reached. HR repair using the homologous chromosome (HR-h) can occur when a Rr3 variant, EJ1, which contains a mutated I-SceI site is present on the homologous chromosome. Repair by HR-h results in dark flies even when the endonuclease is present and can be distinguished from NHEJ by PCR specific to the mutated I-SceI site.</p><fig id="pgen-0040031-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>brca2</italic> Mutations Dramatically Decrease HR-h Repair, Increase SSA Repair, and Result in Increased Deletion Formation</title><p>(A) The Rr3 assay measures the relative repair pathway usage for repair of I-SceI endonuclease-cut breaks in the pre-meiotic germline of Drosophila males.

Progeny resulting from repair by HR-h are also dark even when the endonuclease is present and can be distinguished from NHEJ by PCR.

First, we monitored the extent of gene conversion to the left of the break by determining if the repaired chromosome included a 16 bp deletion 156 bp away from the DSB that was specific to the parental EJ1 chromosome. We designate repaired chromosomes containing the 16 bp deletion as being repaired by long-tract HR-h. Long-tract HR-h repair likely represents repair in which there is increased gene conversion due to increased DNA synthesis rates following strand invasion or due to increased resection prior to DNA synthesis. Alternatively, changes in the repair of the heteroduplex DNA could also influence the balance of repair products observed. Second, large deletions to the left of the DSB result in progeny with white eyes due to the loss of the <italic>white</italic> gene carried on the Rr3 transgene. We performed the Rr3 assay with and without the EJ1 chromosome in order to measure the repair products when repair by HR-h is available and unavailable.

Our results are more similar to the effects seen in mammalian cell culture experiments with hypomorphic <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations, in which decreases in HR repair correlated with increases in SSA repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b026">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, Brough et al. (2008) also have recently reported a similar inverse relationship between SSA and HR-h in a Drosophila <italic>brca2</italic> mutant using a simplified DSB repair assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the Rr3 assay when one pathway is compromised, the sum of the relative pathways usage in these mutants still equals near 100&#x00025;, even though the percentages are calculated from different populations and are not forced to equal 100&#x00025; (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; and our own work). This observation plus the fact that different effects on repair pathway balance have been observed among mutants with decreases in the same pathway suggest that regulated compensation can occur. For example, mutations in <italic>mus101</italic> and <italic>mei-41</italic> both result in a decrease in SSA, but the former are compensated by increases in NHEJ and HR-h, while the latter is compensated by NHEJ only &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In cross 2, we saw a significant increase in the use of the SSA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;1e<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), but no significant difference in the relative level of NHEJ (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.50) in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), indicating compensation by the SSA pathway in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants.</p><p>Compensation of decreases in HR-h by the SSA pathway seems to be a common response to deficiencies in genes required for HR-h. In mammalian cell culture studies, Stark et al. (2004) found a similar inverse relationship between SSA and HR in <italic>Brca2</italic> and <italic>Rad51</italic> mutants, while <italic>Brca1</italic> mutants had decreases in both SSA and HR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. Using the Rr3 assay, Johnson-Schlitz et al<italic>.</italic> (2007) found that the significant decreases in HR-h in Drosophila <italic>dmBlm</italic>, <italic>top3&#x003b1;</italic>, and <italic>spnA</italic> mutants were compensated entirely through increases in SSA, while in <italic>okra</italic> mutants compensation occurred through significant increases in both SSA and NHEJ. In our experiments we observed compensation in <italic>okra</italic> mutants entirely through SSA, and the exact cause of the discrepancy is unclear. Possibly the discrepancy lies in the use of different endonuclease sources or in different combinations of <italic>okra</italic> alleles used (<italic>okra</italic><sup>AA/RU</sup> versus <italic>okra</italic><sup>RU/WS</sup>), though mutagen sensitivity studies have suggested that the AA and WS alleles are of similar strength &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Regardless, it is clear that <italic>brca2</italic> mutants are compensated by SSA, similar to most mutants deficient for HR-h in Drosophila and other organisms.</p><p>It is also notable that short-tract HR-h is more strongly affected in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants than long-tract HR-h. Short-tract HR-h was decreased 64-fold relative to wild-type values and long-tract HR-h was decreased 9-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The residual HR-h repair probably reflects repair that occurred early when low levels of maternal Brca2 were still present and wild-type levels of Brca2 may be required to restrict the extent of gene conversion during HR-h repair. Gene conversion tract length during HR-h repair has important implications in maintaining genomic integrity as the potential for loss of heterozygosity increases with increasing tract length. Mutations in <italic>okra</italic> led to a similar shift towards long-tract HR-h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040031-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and homozygous and heterozygous mutations in <italic>spnA</italic> have also been observed to alter the balance of HR-h in towards long-tract HR-h &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that reductions in levels of the enzymes required for strand invasion can result in increased rates of loss of heterozygosity during HR-h repair. Increased long-tract HR-h repair relative to short-tract HR-h repair in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants may represent increased rate of DNA synthesis, increased resection prior to strand invasion, increased stability of recombination intermediates, unequal repair of the heteroduplex DNA, or a combination of these processes. In mammalian cells, an increase in the extent of gene conversion has been observed in both <italic>Rad51<sup>K133R</sup></italic> and <italic>Xrcc3</italic>, a <italic>Rad51</italic> paralog, mutants; though these observed increases are thought to have arisen from different mechanisms due to differences seen in gene conversion tract continuity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. Models explaining the increase in the inclusion of the 16 bp deletion in Drosophila <italic>brca2</italic> and <italic>spnA</italic> mutants would first need to determine whether conversion tracts in these mutants are continuous or discontinuous by using a more complicated reporter design.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Drosophila Brca2, the 9-1-1 Complex, and Checkpoints</title><p>We found a novel requirement for <italic>brca2</italic> in transduction of the meiotic recombination checkpoint signal. Initially the meiotic phenotypes of <italic>brca2</italic> mutants were surprisingly different from the spindle class mutants previously studied. First, even with the exacerbation of the ventralization defect by growth at 25 &#x000b0;C, the eggshell ventralization phenotype of <italic>brca2</italic> mutants was significantly weaker in spite of similar levels of persistent DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0040031-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Second, the kinetics of the eggshell phenotype were opposite to the kinetics of classical spindle mutants. In <italic>spnA,B,C,D</italic> and <italic>okra</italic> mutants the phenotype is weak during the initial days in which the females are fed yeast, but after 5&#x02013;7 days on yeast spindle mutants lay predominately severely ventralized eggs. In <italic>brca2</italic> mutants, ventralized eggs were only reliably laid during the first 1&#x02013;4 days on yeast (data not shown). Given our results, it is now clear that the requirement for <italic>brca2</italic> in efficient transduction of the checkpoint signal masks the strong eggshell ventralization phenotype that is normally suggestive of a role in meiotic DSB repair. As an increasing number of proteins with dual roles in DNA repair and checkpoint function are being identified, it will be interesting to see if there are additional dual function proteins functioning in Drosophila meiosis. While the classical meiotic repair mutants have strong oogenesis phenotypes, weak or absent eggshell patterning defects may not preclude a role in meiotic DNA repair if coupled to a role in checkpoint transduction.</p><p>We found that the ovarian phenotypes of <italic>brca2</italic> mutants were suppressed by mutations in <italic>chk2</italic>, but were not suppressed by <italic>mei-41</italic> mutations. This finding is in contrast to the other spindle class mutants which are suppressed by both <italic>mei-41</italic> and <italic>chk2</italic> mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Our model is that in females with an intact checkpoint response, the checkpoint activation is dependent upon <italic>mei-41</italic> and <italic>chk2</italic>. However, because Brca2 acts in a similar step in the checkpoint pathway as Mei-41, no additional suppression is observed in the <italic>mei-41; brca2</italic> double mutant. Since both the eggshell and karyosome defects of <italic>brca2</italic> mutants can be suppressed by <italic>chk2</italic> it is probable that the residual checkpoint activation in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants is due to activation of Chk2 by the upstream checkpoint kinase Atm. It is not currently possible to test the involvement of Atm in the checkpoint as even viable, hypomorphic <italic>atm</italic> single mutants have eggshell and karyosome defects. There is however evidence that Mei41-independent checkpoints exist in Drosophila meiosis. Upregulation of transposable elements in the Drosophila germline, as seen in <italic>cutoff</italic> mutants, results in eggshell patterning defects that can be suppressed by <italic>chk2</italic> but not by <italic>mei-41</italic> mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. The checkpoint activated in <italic>cutoff</italic> mutants is, however, distinct in at least some aspects from the checkpoint activated in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants. Unlike in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants, the checkpoint activated in <italic>cutoff</italic> mutants results in a loss of germline cells as well as eggshell patterning defects, and these defects cannot be suppressed by mutations that prevent DSB formation.</p><p>According to our model, Mei41-independent checkpoint activation in <italic>brca2</italic> mutants is strong enough, with respect to either signal strength or signal duration, to result in a karyosome defect but not strong enough to result in strong eggshell patterning defects. Clearly Mei-41 is responsible for the bulk of checkpoint activation in classical spindle mutants but it remains possible that Atm may play a supporting role. It is notable that the classical spindle phenotypes are typically scored after 5&#x02013;7 days on yeast at ambient temperature and that at these conditions the <italic>brca2</italic> single mutant phenotype was very weak (data not shown). Therefore it is possible that under the conditions used in this study <italic>mei-41</italic> mutations may also not completely suppress the classical spindle mutations. In interpreting the role of <italic>brca2</italic> in the transduction of the meiotic recombination signal we have had to focus on the eggshell phenotype as <italic>brca2</italic> single mutants have karyosome defects. This phenotype is similar to that seen in <italic>hus1</italic> mutant females. <italic>hus1</italic> mutants are able to suppress the eggshell defects of spindle mutants but do not suppress the karyosome defects of the spindle mutants as <italic>hus1</italic> single mutants have karyosome defects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Though it has not been tested in this study, it seems possible that, similar to <italic>brca2</italic> mutants, the <italic>hus1</italic> mutant karyosome defect is a result of persistent DSBs and partial activation of the checkpoint.</p><p>We also found that Brca2 co-immunoprecipitated with Rad9. The 9-1-1 complex forms a heterotrimeric ring that is loaded onto resected single-stranded DNA flanking a DSB following replication stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. The 9-1-1 complex associates with DSBs independent of ATR, and mediates Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR through interaction with TopBP1&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b056">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. The 9-1-1 complex may or may not use a similar mechanism to activate Chk2 during the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Although the precise functional relevance of the Rad9-Brca2 interaction remains to be explored, our co-immunoprecipitation results further suggest that the role of Brca2 in checkpoint control is upstream of Chk1/Chk2.</p><p>Research in mammals and our work in Drosophila has shown that the 9-1-1 complex and BRCA2 are specifically required for the checkpoints thought to be activated in response to large stretches of single-stranded DNA. In Drosophila we have shown that they are required for the meiotic recombination checkpoint, but not the irradiation checkpoints. In mammals, BRCA2 and the 9-1-1 complex are required for several S-phase checkpoints &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Now that a physical connection between Rad9 and Brca2 has been observed, it will be interesting to determine the degree of functional overlap between Brca2 and the 9-1-1 complex in the DNA damage responses. In light of the absence of a predicted DNA binding domain in Drosophila <italic>brca2</italic> it is tempting to predict that the Drosophila 9-1-1 complex and Brca2 may have a common role in both repair and checkpoints. While the functional overlap is complete for the checkpoints examined to date, it is clear from mutagen sensitivity assays that the functional overlap between 9-1-1 and Brca2 in DNA repair is not absolute. <italic>hus1</italic> mutants are severely sensitive to MMS, but not to IR, while <italic>brca2</italic> mutants are moderately sensitive to MMS and severely sensitive to IR (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040031-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; and this study).</p><p>In conclusion we have found that the Drosophila homolog of <italic>BRCA2</italic> is required for mitotic and meiotic homologous recombination and in the absence of <italic>brca2</italic> error-prone repair predominates. <italic>brca2,</italic> similar to the 9-1-1 complex with which it physically interacts, has a second requirement during meiosis in the activation of the meiotic recombination checkpoint but is not required for checkpoints that respond to irradiation induced damage, indicating a specialized role for <italic>brca2</italic> in checkpoint control.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains and transgenes.</title><p>Flies were maintained at 25 &#x000b0;C.
