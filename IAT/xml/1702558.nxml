The skin consists of three main layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. It is the thickness of a sheet of paper and forms a barrier that prevents the body losing water or infectious agents entering it. The cells in the epidermis are mainly keratinocytes. These specialized skin cells are continually produced at the base of the epidermis. From there, they move toward the skin's surface where they are shed. The middle layer is the dermis. It is about ten times thicker than the epidermis and contains the blood vessels that feed the skin, nerves, sebaceous glands, and hair follicles. The final, subcutaneous layer contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels and fat. The dermis contains collagen fibers that support the skin and elastin fibers that provide flexibility. Human skin begins to age in early adulthood. By the time a person is 80 years old, their epidermis may be half its original thickness because of decreased keratinocyte proliferation. The dermis also thins, and loss of collagen and elastin fibers means that the skin becomes less elastic. The gradual loss of epidermis and dermis&#x02014;skin atrophy&#x02014;is clinically important because aging skin is more fragile and heals slower than young skin and is also prone to ulceration.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>No one knows why skin atrophy occurs, but it is becoming more common as people live longer, and there is no effective treatment for it. One characteristic of atrophic skin is that, compared to normal skin, it contains less hyaluronate (also called hyaluronan and hyaluronic acid)&#x02014;a large carbohydrate component of the extracellular matrix, the material that surrounds cells. It also contains less CD44, a cell-surface protein that interacts with hyaluronate. This interaction can stimulate cell proliferation and migration. Given these observations, in this study the researchers have investigated whether treating atrophic skin with fragments of hyaluronate might counteract atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers isolated keratinocytes from normal mice and from CD44-deficient mice (CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice) and treated them with different sized fragments of hyaluronate. Intermediate sized hyaluronate fragments (so-called HAFi) but not large or small fragments increased the proliferation of normal keratinocytes but not CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes. This suggests that proliferation in response to HAFi is CD44-dependent. Similarly, a cream of HAFi applied to the backs of normal mice caused thickening of the epidermal layer but had no effect on CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Finally, topical application of HAFi for one month caused skin thickening and clinical improvement in six people with skin atrophy but had no effect on normal human skin. The collagen, elastic fiber, and blood vessel content of the dermis also increased in treated patients. By using antibodies to block the function of various proteins, the researchers also discovered that heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF, a protein that stimulates keratinocyte proliferation), erbB1 (a cell-surface protein that binds HB-EGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (proteins that activate HB-EGF) are all required for the stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation by HAFi.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Taken together, these results provide the first indication that application of HAFi to atrophic skin might be useful therapeutically. The absence of any effect on normal human skin is reassuring but puzzling given the thickening seen in normal mouse skin, so this finding needs confirmation before hyaluronate fragments are used clinically. Longer trials in more people are also needed to characterize the clinical effects fully. Finally, the mechanism by which hyaluronate fragments have their effect needs to be studied in more depth. Such studies might reveal other potential therapeutic options for the treatment of skin atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030493">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030493</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/004014.htm">MedlinePlus </ext-link>encyclopedia entry on aging changes in skin</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niapublications.org/agepages/skin.asp">US National Institute on Aging</ext-link>, patient information on skin care and aging</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.skincarephysicians.com/agingskinnet">American Academy of Dermatology</ext-link>, patient information on aging skin</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information on CD44, the hyaluronan receptor, provided by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.glycoforum.gr.jp/science/hyaluronan/HA10a/HA10aE.html">Glycoforum</ext-link> a source of information on glycobiology</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikpedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin">skin and on</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan">hyaluronan</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kaya G, Tran CT, Sorg O, Hotz R, Grand D. et al.

Cleavage of the HA polymer during tissue remodeling gives rise to lower-molecular-weight fragments that elicit a variety of CD44-mediated cellular responses, including proliferation, migration, and cytokine synthesis. Increasing evidence suggests that cellular responses elicited by HA depend on the size of the HA oligosaccharides as well as on the responding cell type &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.

Expression levels, variant isoform selection, and glycosylation all play an important role in the ability of CD44 to bind HA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Because of its polymeric structure, HA can crosslink several CD44 molecules on the surface of a cell, an effect that is believed to be essential in triggering proliferative, invasive, and promigratory signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. HA-mediated CD44 clustering can have a variety of effects, depending, at least in part, on the CD44 isoform that is implicated in HA binding. Thus, in mouse mammary and uterine epithelia, HA can induce heparan sulfate&#x02013;bearing variants of CD44 (CD44v3) to recruit a cell-surface complex that includes matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP-7), heparin-binding epidermal-like growth factor (HB-EGF) precursor HB-EGF (pro-HB-EGF), and erbB4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

CD44 in turn appears to play an important role in maintaining HA homeostasis in skin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, and its levels appear to correlate with skin trophicity. Thus, decreased epidermal CD44 expression is associated with the pathogenesis of an atrophic skin disorder known as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Conversely, epidermal hyperplasia induced by topical administration of retinoids in mouse skin is accompanied by increased CD44 and HA synthase (HAS) expression with a concomitant increase in HA deposition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. To elucidate the mechanism whereby HA might induce keratinocyte proliferation, and to determine the response of the epidermis to its application in vivo, we examined the effect of HAF of varying size on in vitro&#x02013;cultured mouse keratinocyte growth, and skin trophicity of DBA/1 wild-type (wt) and CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice SKH1 hairless mice, as well as normal and atrophic human skin. Our observations indicate that HAF of 50,000&#x02013;400,000 Da, defined as intermediate-size HAF (HAFi), induce keratinocyte proliferation and skin hyperplasia by a CD44-dependent mechanism that requires proteolytic activation of HB-EGF and engagement of erbB1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Preparation of HAFi</title><p>HA from rooster comb (IAL) for clinical application was provided by Transbussan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.transbussan.com">http://www.transbussan.com</ext-link>).

Here we show that both HAFs and HAFi penetrate mouse skin in vivo, but that only the HAFi induce cellular proliferation within the epidermal and dermal compartments.</p><p>At least two types of effects occurred as a result of topical HAFi application: CD44-independent penetration of skin and induction of HAS and Hyal2, and CD44-dependent keratinocyte proliferation. Both fibroblasts and endothelial cells also proliferated in response to HAFi in vitro, providing a possible explanation for the increased dermal collagen deposition and angiogenesis, respectively, observed in vivo. However, the contribution of fibroblast activity and angiogenesis to epidermal hyperplasia was most likely of minor importance, given that conditioned culture media of HAFi-stimulated fibroblasts and endothelial cells failed to augment keratinocyte proliferation. Importantly, an increase in human skin thickness in response to HAFi was observed only in patients with skin atrophy. Although the reasons of the absence of such a response in healthy participants can only be speculative at present, it is possible that physiological HA production saturates tissue CD44 binding capacity in the steady state, such that additional exogenous HA fragments fail to induce a significant CD44-dependent response. Whatever the precise mechanism, the absence of skin hyperplasia in healthy participants in response to HAFi suggests that topical HAFi administration does not present the risk of inducing undesirable local side effects.</p><p>Penetration of HA fragments into the dermis may occur via hair follicles, which provide a well-recognized route for macromolecular skin penetration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; and could explain the dermal localization of HAFs and HAFi.

HAFi was observed to induce HAS expression consistent with the possibility that increased local HA synthesis may contribute to the increased HA content. The mechanism whereby HAFi might induce local HAS and hyaluronidase expression is unknown.

It would appear that mechanisms independent of CD44 might sense changes in local HA concentration, or that HAFi stimulate receptors other than CD44 to induce HAS and hyaluronidase expression. Increased tissue HA concentration typically occurs in the context of development, injury, and tumor growth, and is believed to actively participate in the process of tissue remodeling. It is conceivable that an increase in tissue HA, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, is interpreted by local fibroblasts to reflect a remodeling process, triggering additional HA synthesis and degradation.</p><p>Proliferation in response to HAFi is a CD44-dependent event. Our present observations provide evidence that in addition to CD44, HB-EGF, erbB1, and MMPs/ADAMs are required for HA-dependent in vitro keratinocyte proliferation. The absence of a proliferative response of CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> keratinocytes to HB-EGF is consistent with the notion that HB-EGF interaction with its receptors requires presentation by heparan sulfate side chains of CD44v3-containing isoforms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Accordingly, topical application of HAFi oligosaccharide resulted in a significant increase in pro-HB-EGF and HB-EGF, while inhibition of MMP activity by TIMP-3 abrogated the corresponding proliferative response.</p><p>The observation that anti-erbB1&#x02013; and anti&#x02013;HB-EGF&#x02013;blocking antibodies had the same abrogating effect as the absence of CD44 on in vitro keratinocyte proliferation in response to HAFi supports the notion that erbB1 signaling, triggered by HB-EGF, may play a key role in HAFi-induced proliferation. Similar to its role in uterine and mammary epithelia, HA-induced CD44v3 aggregates may recruit a functional cell-surface complex in keratinocytes composed of pro-HB-EGF, erbB1, which replaces erbB4, and an MMP or ADAM &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030493-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. MMP/ADAM-mediated proteolytic cleavage of HB-EGF and CD44-mediated presentation of mature HB-EGF to erbB1 may then induce proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030493-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Our observations have defined 50,000&#x02013;400,000 Da HAF as reagents capable of inducing a proliferative response in mouse and human skin. Clinically, topical HAFi application resulted in epidermal hyperplasia with restoration to normal thickness of atrophic human skin as early as 1 mo after initiation of treatment. This effect was accompanied by significant clinical improvement, suggesting that HAFi may provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for skin diseases characterized by atrophy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0030493-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>The Effect of TPA on CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mouse Skin</title><p>(A) TPA induces a reduced skin hyperplasia in CD44<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.
