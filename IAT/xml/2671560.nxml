The processing of these bases by DNA repair activities was proposed to cause DNA-directed cytotoxicity, but the underlying mechanisms have not been resolved. In this study, we investigated a possible role of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), one of four mammalian uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs), in the cellular response to 5-FU. Using genetic and biochemical tools, we found that inactivation of TDG significantly increases resistance of both mouse and human cancer cells towards 5-FU. We show that excision of DNA-incorporated 5-FU by TDG generates persistent DNA strand breaks, delays S-phase progression, and activates DNA damage signaling, and that the repair of 5-FU&#x02013;induced DNA strand breaks is more efficient in the absence of TDG. Hence, excision of 5-FU by TDG, but not by other UDGs (UNG2 and SMUG1), prevents efficient downstream processing of the repair intermediate, thereby mediating DNA-directed cytotoxicity. The status of TDG expression in a cancer is therefore likely to determine its response to 5-FU&#x02013;based chemotherapy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) has been used in clinical cancer therapy for more than four decades. Despite a moderate response rate and a high propensity of tumors to develop resistance to the drug, 5-FU remains a mainstay in the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer in particular. But precisely how 5-FU kills cancerous cells is not well understood. It is known, for example, that 5-FU affects RNA or DNA metabolism. Its DNA-directed cytotoxicity is thought to be based on extensive misincorporation of uracil and 5-FU into cellular DNA, and it has been proposed that the excision of these bases by uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs) results in destructive DNA fragmentation, which can ultimately lead to cell death. However, the UDG responsible has not been identified. We now show that inactivation of only one of four mammalian UDGs, the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in mouse and human cells is sufficient to confer resistance to 5-FU, whereas overexpression of TDG sensitizes cells to the drug. We provide further experimental evidence to show that excision of 5-FU from DNA by TDG, but not by other UDGs, inhibits efficient downstream processing of the lesion. This leads to an accumulation of DNA repair intermediates, which induce DNA damage signaling and, eventually, cell death. Thus, TDG activity in cells represents an important determinant of the DNA-directed cytotoxicity of 5-FU, an observation that might help us to understand the variable response to 5-FU treatments in cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Targeted disruption of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) in mouse cells and down-regulation in human cancer cells establishes an important role of this protein in the cellular response to the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kunz C, Focke F, Saito Y, Schuermann D, Lettieri T, et al.

These metabolites have been implicated in both global RNA metabolism due to incorporation of the ribonucleotide FUMP into RNA, and DNA metabolism due to TS inhibition or direct incorporation of FdUMP into DNA.

Thus, TS inhibition deprives the cell of the capacity to synthesize dTMP from dUMP and, thereby, elevates deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) levels at the expense of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP). The resulting dUTP/dTTP imbalance then favors the misincorporation of dUMP during DNA replication, giving rise to a dose-dependent increase in the steady-state level of DNA uracil &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>It has been argued that the therapeutic effects of TS inhibition are based on the fragmentation of genomic DNA as a result of massive uracil excision by the replication-associated uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) UNG2 connected with futile cycles of base excision repair (BER) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, uracil excision by UNG2 is not likely to account for the DNA-directed cytotoxicity of 5-FU. In light of a recent report, however, showing that FdUMP gets itself incorporated into genomic DNA in 5-FU&#x02013;treated cells, with levels even exceeding those of misincorporated uracil &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, it can be argued that the 5-FU rather than the uracil in the DNA is the cell toxic lesion.</p><p>Although UNG is the most efficient and specific UDG present in mammalian cells, it is not the only one.

Although it has a strong preference for bases mispaired with a guanine, TDG excises 5-FU with a high efficiency, irrespective of whether the opposite base is a guanine or an adenine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, recent evidence from in vitro repair studies has implicated the postreplicative mismatch repair (MMR) system in the processing of 5-FU&#x02022;G base pairs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

Hence, the DNA-directed effects of 5-FU may reflect two lines of responses: the excision of 5-FU or U from DNA (5-FU/U&#x02022;A, 5-FU/U&#x02022;G) mainly by UDGs, and the excision of mismatched nucleotides mainly by MMR.</p><p>The objective of this study was to clarify the role of TDG in this context.

We then used litter-matched MEF lines for phenotypic examination. Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-mouse TDG antibody confirmed that neither full-length nor truncated versions of TDG were present in whole-cell extracts of the homozygous knockout MEFs, whereas heterozygous cells produced about half endogenous levels of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g001">Figure 1</xref>A; unpublished data). Continuous exposure of these MEFs to 5-FU for 48 h reduced living cell counts in a dose-dependent manner.

This confirmed that the 5-FU resistance of <italic>Tdg</italic> knockout cells is a direct consequence of the loss of TDG rather than of unspecific effects by SV40 LTA immortalization or other differences in clonal backgrounds.</p><p>To validate the resistance phenotype in cells that are naturally immortal, we examined the 5-FU response of <italic>Tdg<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Tdg<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) (Y.

Hence, the mechanism by which TDG mediates cytotoxicity of 5-FU is active in very divergent cell types, including immortalized differentiated cells as well as undifferentiated stem cells.</p><p>To examine the drug specificity of this phenotype, we assessed the sensitivities of TDG-proficient and -deficient MEFs towards the monofunctional DNA alkylating agent methyl methansulfonate (MMS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). At MMS concentrations yielding &#x02265;10&#x00025; cell survival, the TDG status did not significantly affect cellular sensitivity. At higher concentrations (&#x02264;5&#x00025; survival), however, TDG-deficient cells were slightly more sensitive. Thus, TDG may contribute to the repair of MMS-induced DNA lesions, but it does not mediate cytotoxicity as it does in the case of 5-FU.</p><p>Finally, to address the impact of TDG on long-term survival of 5-FU&#x02013;treated human cancer cells, we performed clonogenic survival assays. We established HeLa cell clones either stably transfected with a construct overexpressing human TDG from a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or with the corresponding vector only. In addition, we applied a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to knockdown TDG in both HeLa cell clones. Continuous exposure of these HeLa cells to 5-FU for 72 h reduced colony forming units in a dose-dependent manner. The cellular sensitivity, however, significantly correlated with TDG protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), being highest for TDG-overexpressing cells and lowest for the vector control cells with additional TDG knockdown. Thus, reduced TDG expression confers a long-term survival benefit to HeLa cells, establishing that the TDG expression status in a human cancer cell line determines its response to treatment with 5-FU.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>TDG Contributes to A&#x02022;5-FU Repair in Nuclear Extracts</title><p>Biochemical studies revealed that the human TDG acts on a rather broad range of substrates, including G&#x02022;U and G&#x02022;5-FU mispairs, but also 5-FU base-paired with adenine. 5-FU, in fact, turned out to be the only base that is efficiently processed by TDG in the normal base-pairing configuration or even in single-stranded DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. We thus reasoned that the excision of 5-FU and/or uracil from genomic DNA by TDG might be a source of 5-FU&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity in TDG-proficient cells. To test this, we first validated the 5-FU&#x02013; and uracil-processing abilities of purified mouse TDG in base-release assays. This showed that, like its human counterpart, the mouse protein excises thymine, uracil, and 5-FU opposite guanine, but also 5-FU paired with adenine, all with comparable efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

In the light of our biochemical evidence, implicating TDG in processing genomic A&#x02022;5-FU base pairs, this might be accounted for by an accumulation of apyrimidinic/apurinic sites (AP-sites) in DNA. Through further processing by the BER system, spontaneous breakage, or stalling of DNA polymerases, these could give rise to increased levels of single-stranded DNA breaks (SSBs) in cells. To test this hypothesis, we applied alkaline Comet analyses to assess 5-FU&#x02013;induced SSB formation in TDG-proficient and -deficient MEFs, as well as in complemented knockout cells stably expressing an ectopic wild-type or catalytic mutant <italic>Tdg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).

Following treatment with 5 &#x003bc;M 5-FU for 24 h and a recovery of another 24 h, however, the tail moments increased significantly above background in TDG-proficient populations, whereas no significant increase was detected for TDG-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Remarkably, cells complemented with the catalytic-inactive mutant form of TDG did not show significantly elevated tail moments after 5-FU treatment. These data indicate that base excision by TDG accounts for the increase in steady-state levels of DNA strand breaks observed upon treatment of cells with 5-FU.</p><fig id="pbio-1000091-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>5-FU&#x02013;Induced DNA Strand Breaks Are Reduced in TDG-Deficient Cells whereas Overall Repair Activity Is Increased.</title><p>(A) Complementation of <italic>Tdg</italic> knockout MEFs with wild-type and catalytically deficient TDG.

We therefore conclude that uracil/5-FU excision from genomic DNA activates SSB repair processes at the site of the lesion.

Since a treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) impeded S-phase progression equally in both cell lines (unpublished data), a defective intra&#x02013;S-phase DNA-damage checkpoint in the TDG knockout MEFs can be excluded.

We show that inactivation of <italic>Tdg</italic> in MEFs, but also in ES cells, results in a marked cellular resistance towards 5-FU, which can be complemented by expression of wild-type <italic>Tdg</italic>. The same inverse correlation between TDG proficiency and 5-FU sensitivity was observed with the human cancer cell line HeLa; TDG overexpression in HeLa cells increased cellular sensitivity to 5-FU treatment, whereas siRNA-mediated TDG knockdown in the same cells provided resistance. This phenotype is apparently specific to 5-FU as the TDG-deficient MEFs showed no resistance when treated with MMS. Recently, An et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; demonstrated the accumulation of appreciable amounts of FdUMP in genomic DNA following 5-FU treatment of cells, and further presented genetic evidence consistent with 5-FU rather than uracil in DNA being the toxic lesion. Our data show that nuclear extracts from TDG-deficient cells excise 5-FU from A&#x02022;5-FU base pairs with significantly reduced efficiency when compared to wild-type extracts. Although this difference is detectable only upon inhibition of the highly active UNG2 by the UGI peptide, it nevertheless implicates a rate-limiting contribution of TDG to the excision of 5-FU in non&#x02013;S-phase cells, where UNG2 activity is down-regulated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b033">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In agreement with this, we found TDG-deficient MEFs to accumulate significantly higher levels of 5-FU in their DNA than TDG-proficient cells following 5-FU exposure.

Strikingly, after 5-FU treatment, <italic>Tdg</italic> knockout cells produced significantly higher levels of XRCC1 foci than their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that the loss of TDG enhances overall SSB repair activity while reducing lethal 5-FU processing.</p><p>Why then is the excision of 5-FU (or uracil) by TDG cytotoxic, whereas excision by other UDGs, particularly Smug1, protects against cell death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;? The difference may relate to the distinct modes of action of these enzymes. Both TDG and Smug1 bind AP-sites in DNA, albeit with different affinities. The dissociation of the glycosylases from these repair intermediates is therefore rate limiting for further processing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. However, whereas Smug1 can be made to turnover in the presence of APE1, the downstream-acting endonuclease competing for the AP-site &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, efficient AP-site release (and stimulation by APE1) of TDG requires a SUMO modification&#x02013;induced conformational change that reduces its DNA binding affinity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, base excision by Smug1 may connect to a straightforward downstream repair process, whereas base excision by TDG may be associated with delayed repair of the AP-site, possibly due to saturation of the SUMOylation system. Some AP-sites generated by TDG would thus escape repair until they eventually interfere with DNA replication, leading to fork stalling and collapse, and activation of replication stress or DNA-damage checkpoints &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, we and others found 5-FU treatment to affect the progression of cells through S-phase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, and this effect was associated with activation of the Chk1 kinase that contributes to S and G2/M checkpoints &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Both an accumulation of cells in S-phase and the activation Chk1 upon 5-FU exposure were virtually absent in TDG-deficient MEFs, and were in line with reduced levels of 5-FU&#x02013;induced DNA strand breaks and &#x003b3;H2AX foci in these cells.</p><p>We reported previously that TDG is absent from S-phase cells due to programmed degradation by the proteasome system at the G1&#x02013;S boundary &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. This is consistent with the dynamics of Chk1 activation and cell death in our experiments, both indicating that the TDG-dependent cytotoxic action is temporally separated from the incorporation of 5-FU (and U) into DNA. On the basis of these findings, we can now put forward a model for how temporally separated 5-FU/uracil misincorporation and repair processes can determine the cellular responses to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000091-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Upon exposure to 5-FU, 5-FU/uracil will be misincorporated into DNA during DNA replication in S-phase of the cell cycle. In this context, UNG2 will act efficiently on uracil (A&#x02022;U and G&#x02022;U) but less so on 5-FU &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas Smug1 (and MBD4) may process the same lesions but with lower efficiencies. These repair events will activate the first wave of checkpoint responses that is TDG independent. Due to saturation of uracil repair, considerable amounts of A&#x02022;5-FU base pairs will persist in the DNA into the subsequent phases of the cell cycle, where UNG2 is down-regulated, and they will be attacked mainly by TDG and Smug1. AP-sites generated by TDG will be protected from repair due to rate-limiting dissociation of the glycosylase and, hence, accumulate and interfere with the replication machinery in the subsequent S-phase. This will give rise to a second wave of checkpoint activation (Chk1 phosphorylation and formation of &#x003b3;H2AX), this time TDG dependent, which is correlated with the occurrence of DNA strand breaks, even if the cells are no longer cultivated in the presence of 5-FU.</p><fig id="pbio-1000091-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>TDG-Dependent 5-FU Cytotoxicity</title><p>Illustrated are the cell-cycle distributions of the three relevant UDGs, TDG, UNG2, and Smug1 (top), together with expected levels of genomic 5-FU, uracil, AP-sites, and the observed Chk1 activation following 5-FU treatment (bottom). TDG is present during the G2/M and G1 phases but is degraded prior to and absent from S-phase. UNG2 shows a strictly inverse regulation whereas Smug1 is expressed throughout the entire cell cycle. Treatment with 5-FU for 24 h gives rise to misincorporation of appreciable levels of 5-FU and uracil during S-phase (S1), resulting in Chk1 activation by ongoing replication-associated UNG2 and Smug1-dependent BER. Although Smug1 and UNG2 will initiate faithful repair of uracil and 5-FU bases directly after DNA synthesis, these pathways will become saturated under 5-FU exposure and, in addition, are relatively inefficient in processing the 5-FU&#x02022;A base pairs. Hence, some of them will persist in the DNA into the subsequent G2 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. There, TDG will initiate repair, but turnover with a low rate, leading to an accumulation of AP-sites and/or DNA SSBs. During the subsequent S-phase, these repair intermediates will interfere with DNA replication, causing replication fork stalling, fork collapse, DNA double-strand breaks, and a second round of Chk1 activation. Due to genome fragmentation, cells will then induce apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000091.g007"/></fig><p>Notably, according to a recent report, breast cancer patients carrying a specific polymorphism in XRCC1 have a significantly reduced risk of recurrence and show better long time survival following a combination therapy with cyclophosphamide&#x02013;methotrexate&#x02013;5-FU &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000091-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;.

It is now becoming clear that the efficiency of coupling downstream repair with base excision, presumably through XRCC1, depends on the biochemical properties of the DNA glycosylase engaged and critically determines the cellular responses to the drug. It will therefore be important to examine to what extent the status of TDG activity correlates with the response of tumors to 5-FU&#x02013;based chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents, antibodies, and <italic>Tdg</italic> expression constructs.</title><p>Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma, Complete protease inhibitor from Roche, RNase from Qiagen and UGI from New England Biolabs.

Coverslips were then washed twice in PBS and the cells fixed for 15 min with PF-buffer (PBS, 2&#x00025; paraformaldehyde) at RT, washed 4&#x000d7; 10 min in PBS at RT, and permeabilized in ice-cold P-buffer (PBS, 0.2&#x00025; TritonX100) for 5 min. Coverslips were incubated for another 5 min in ice-cold P-buffer containing 0.2&#x00025; NaBH<sub>4</sub>. After blocking twice in H-buffer for 10 min (PBS, 1&#x00025; BSA) and once in D-buffer for 10 min (PBS, 1:20 donkey serum), samples were hybridized with the anti-XRCC1 (1:100 dilution in H-buffer) or the anti-&#x003b3;H2AX (1:500 dilution in H-buffer) antibody for 1 h at RT. Following four washes of 10 min in H-buffer, the samples were hybridized with the respective Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:500 (XRCC1) or 1:200 (&#x003b3;H2AX) in H-buffer for 1 h at RT. After four washes of 10 min in PBS, the coverslips were dried and embedded in Mowiol (Calbiochem, Germany).
