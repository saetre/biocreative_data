We present the solution structure of the non-catalytic ERCC1 central domain. Although this domain shows structural homology with the catalytically active XPF nuclease domain, functional investigation reveals a completely distinct function for the ERCC1 central domain by performing interactions with both XPA and single-stranded DNA. These interactions are non-competitive and can occur simultaneously through distinct interaction surfaces. Interestingly, the XPA binding by ERCC1 and the catalytic function of XPF are dependent on a structurally homologous region of the two proteins. Although these regions are strictly conserved in each protein family, amino acid composition and surface characteristics are distinct. We discuss the possibility that after XPF gene duplication, the redundant ERCC1 central domain acquired novel functions, thereby increasing the fidelity of eukaryotic DNA repair.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During DNA replication, recombination and repair, double-stranded DNA inevitably forms three- or four-way junctions, bubbles, flaps or broken ends with single-stranded extensions. These irregular structures must be processed correctly in order to successfully complete DNA metabolism and thereby maintain genome integrity. This task is accomplished by structure-specific endonucleases specialized in pruning downstream of branch, flap or bubble structures by incision at junctions between double- and single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Inactivation or malfunctioning of these enzymes causes genetic defects or cancer, underlying their importance in genome stability.</p><p>A remarkable class of structure-specific endonucleases in humans is XPF. The protein family is characterized by the presence of the ERCC4 domain and consists of seven members (XPF, MUS81, ERCC1, EME1, EME2, FANCM and FAAP24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Only XPF and MUS81 have nuclease activity, which is mediated by the conserved core nuclease motif (ERKX<sub>3</sub>D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Their catalytic function depends on heterodimer formation with the non-catalytic family members. XPF forms an obligate complex with ERCC1 and functions primarily in nucleotide excision repair (NER), a versatile pathway able to detect and remove a variety of DNA lesions induced by UV light and environmental carcinogens. The ERCC1/XPF heterodimer has additional roles in DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The symptoms of the first patient with inherited ERCC1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and of a patient with a novel XPF mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) are distinct from the classical NER phenotype, and underscore the pleiotropic function of ERCC1/XPF.</p><p>In contrast to eukaryotes, archaea have a single homolog of the XPF endonuclease that forms homodimers. The archaeal XPF minimally consists of the catalytic nuclease domain followed by a DNA-binding domain containing two consecutive helix-hairpin-helix motifs (HhH<sub>2</sub> domain). Dimerization occurs between both the nuclease and HhH<sub>2</sub> domains of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The strong preference of the archaeal endonucleases for 3&#x02032; flap DNA substrates is explained by the function of their individual domains. Structural data suggest a model for DNA binding where one HhH<sub>2</sub> domain of the dimer binds to an upstream and the other to a downstream DNA duplex, sharply bending the DNA substrate and thereby allowing one active site of the dimeric nuclease domain to cleave the 3&#x02032; protruding single strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Combination of mutations in nuclease and HhH<sub>2</sub> domains that do not disrupt the dimeric interfaces but impair the individual functions (DNA cleavage or DNA binding), provide evidence for this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of the archaeal XPF homodimeric members and the human ERCC1/XPF heterodimer.

The human enzyme is known to specifically incise hairpin, bubble or splayed-arm DNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), which consist of only one duplex (upstream). Previous data indicated the role of the C-terminal ERCC1 &#x02018;canonical&#x02019; HhH<sub>2</sub> domain in engaging the upstream DNA duplex of a hairpin substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This function requires heterodimerization with the C-terminal HhH domain of the human XPF partner to form a complex analogous to the archaeal HhH<sub>2</sub> dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Previous structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and the data presented here illustrate the structural similarity between the human ERCC1 central domain and the archaeal XPF nuclease domain. Unlike the archaeal nuclease dimer interface, there is no evidence that the corresponding domains of human ERCC1 and XPF interact with each other in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The catalytic function of the ERCC1/XPF endonuclease is crucial for NER. NER operates through a &#x02018;cut and patch&#x02019; mechanism by excising and removing a short stretch of DNA containing the lesion, and subsequently restoring the genetic information by repair synthesis using the undamaged strand as the template. The incision step involves the sequential and coordinated assembly of the DNA damage sensor XPC-HR23B, the transcription/repair factor TFIIH, the architectural protein XPA, the ubiquitous ssDNA-binding protein RPA, and the two structure-specific endonucleases ERCC1/XPF and XPG, responsible for the incisions 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; to the damaged site, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). A main role in the progress of the reaction is attributed to XPA, which in complex with RPA probes the DNA helix conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and participates in multiple interactions with the other NER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). XPA is required for the recruitment of ERCC1/XPF in the NER pre-incision complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Consistent with this regulatory function, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with recombinant proteins and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using a yeast two-hybrid system have demonstrated interactions between XPA and ERCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the solution structure of the ERCC1 central domain (cERCC1) and investigate its interactions with XPA and DNA at the molecular level. Using biochemical studies and NMR titration experiments, we have identified two distinct interaction surfaces of cERCC1 that mediate XPA and DNA binding. Interestingly, the two interactions can take place simultaneously to yield a cERCC1/DNA/XPA ternary complex, which in turn explains the important role of ERCC1 in targeting its catalytic XPF partner to the NER pre-incision complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning, protein expression and protein purification</title><p>ERCC1 central domain (cERCC1, residues 96 to 219) was PCR-amplified from a vector containing the full-length ERCC1 gene and subcloned into a pET28b (Novagen) expression vector between BamHI and XhoI sites. Downstream of the XhoI site a linker together with a his-tag has been engineered. XPA constructs were derived from a full-length XPA vector purchased from RZPD (clone ID IRAUp969B1273D6) and subcloned into a pLICHIS vector using the enzyme free cloning (EFC) strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The same procedure was followed for the GST fusion proteins, either XPA or cERCC1 (pLICHISGST vector). As a result all the EFC constructs contain an N-terminal his-tag, while the cERCC1 construct bears a C-terminal his-tag. The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNAs were confirmed by sequencing. The cERCC1-HIS, HIS-XPA, HIS-GST-XPA and HIS-GST-cERCC1 proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Rosetta cells (Novagen) and were subject to two-step purification as has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). When appropriate, HIS-GST-cERCC1 was cleaved with thrombin in the presence of 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl in order to obtain the untagged protein. Finally, the protein samples were exchanged either to 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 100 mM NaCl for the cERCC1 structure determination, or to 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl for the binding studies.</p></sec><sec><title>NMR spectroscopy</title><p>Multidimensional NMR experiments were carried out at 290 K on Bruker AVANCE 600 and 900 NMR spectrometers equipped with TXI triple-resonance probes in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 100 mM NaCl by using the cERCC1-HIS protein.

From the cERCC1 structure and its compact fold, we predict that such truncations will have a devastating effect on the structural integrity of the central domain (96&#x02013;219). For XPA, the ERCC1 interaction region seems to be located in a small stretch containing two highly conserved motifs rich in glycine and glutamic acid residues (72-<underline>GGGF</underline>IL<underline>EEEE</underline>EEE-84, conserved residues are underlined) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We have prepared a HIS-GST-XPA construct (59&#x02013;99) containing the conserved stretch, and examined its ability to interact with cERCC1 in a GST pull-down assay. Indeed, the GST XPA fusion protein was able to specifically bind cERCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), confirming that this domain of ERCC1 is sufficient for interactions with XPA. No binding of cERCC1 to GST bound agarose beads or uncharged agarose beads was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, data not shown). This XPA peptide is unstructured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and appeared very sensitive to proteolysis both during overexpression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and as pure protein after extensive purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B).

Since we reached only 20% binding saturation at the two highest protein concentrations (3 and 10 &#x000b5;M of cERCC1) under these experimental conditions, we could not determine the binding constant more accurately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>ERCC1&#x02013;XPA interactions.

Titration with the HIS-XPA peptide causes extensive specific changes in the cERCC1 <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra. The titrations show slow exchange regime with respect to the NMR chemical shift timescale, in agreement with the determined affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). We have been able to assign all the amide resonances of cERCC1 in the bound form (1:1 complex stoichiometry) by using 3D NOESY-(<sup>15</sup>N, <sup>1</sup>H)-HSQC spectra. The pattern of the backbone amide NOEs does not change substantially compared to the free cERCC1 protein. This indicates that the overall structure is maintained, and led us to conclude that the observed chemical shift perturbations arise from specific contacts with the XPA peptide.</p><p>The most significant perturbations map to the surface of the V-shaped groove of the cERCC1 structure and involve many residues that compose the corresponding DNA cleavage site of the archaeal XPF endonucleases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Interestingly, among the largest chemical shifts of cERCC1 upon XPA binding are those of L139, F140 and L141. These ERCC1 residues correspond to the characteristic strongly conserved ERK catalytic triad of the XPF nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The rest of the significantly perturbed residues are polar or positively charged (Q107, N110, S142, R144, N147 and R156), are competent for hydrogen bonding with the XPA peptide and are more conserved than the surrounding regions of the cERCC1 V-shaped groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, of special interest are the amide signals of G109 and H149, which are not observed in the free protein spectrum due to fast exchange with the solvent at pH 8 (these amide resonances are observable at pH 5.5). However, both give sharp signals at the end of the titration, an indication that the solvent exchange in the free protein is quenched in the complex. These residues reside at the rim of the V-shaped binding site and may be involved in hydrogen bonding with the XPA peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although ERCC1 residues forming the XPA-binding site are different from the acidic and basic residues which form the active site in XPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), there are no significant changes in the backbone fold and the spatial side-chain orientations in the structure remain unaffected. However, their different chemical properties result in a distinct charge and hydrophobicity distribution on the structure surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). While XPF displays negative charge at the DNA cleavage site (important for divalent cation coordination), the equivalent XPA-binding site in ERCC1 is neutral or slightly positively charged. Therefore, the ERCC1&#x02013;XPA interaction is a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions possibly involving the glutamic acid stretch of XPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) and two conserved positively charged residues (R106 and R156) of cERCC1.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA binding by the ERCC1 central domain</title><p>Given the proposed common origin of ERCC1 and XPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), it can be expected that the degenerated catalytic site of ERCC1 could still bind DNA in a similar fashion as the archaeal XPF active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Because our ERCC1&#x02013;XPA interaction data render this unlikely, we explored whether cERCC1 is able to bind DNA as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>We performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) where increasing amounts of cERCC1-HIS protein were added to ssDNA. While we saw a loss of free probe, we failed to see any complex formation under these conditions. If the same protein&#x02013;DNA complex was loaded on a 3.5% agarose gel, we detected a weak smeary complex at the highest protein concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). However, by using a HIS-GST-cERCC1 protein, we observed formation of the complex with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). This suggests that the C-terminal his-tag interferes with DNA binding. Therefore, we used the HIS-GST-cERCC1 protein, which we cleaved with thrombin to obtain the untagged protein. DNA binding with the untagged cERCC1 demonstrated a faster migrating complex with various ssDNA substrates (data not shown). HIS-GST-cERCC1/DNA complex formation is prevented by incubation of the reaction mixture with MagneHIS magnetic beads or glutathione agarose beads, which depletes HIS-GST-cERCC1 from the reaction mixture either prior to or after the addition of DNA. If beads were added after complex formation, a small but significant decrease in the amount of free probe was observed. Depletion of the HIS-GST tagged cERCC1 protein from the binding reaction confirms that the protein&#x02013;DNA complex is indeed formed by the HIS-GST-cERCC1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>DNA binding by cERCC1.

The relatively small difference in affinity can be well explained by different salt conditions or substrate used.</p><p>For the NMR titrations we performed a thrombin cleavage on HIS-GST-cERCC1, to remove the his-tag. The untagged cERCC1 <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum is identical to that of cERCC1-HIS, except for the two amides preceding the artificial his-tag (Supplementary Figure 1). Addition of the b10 substrate to this cERCC1 protein caused a limited number of specific perturbations that were unambiguously assigned. Again, the perturbed resonances exhibit slow exchange behavior in the NMR titrations and indicate contacts with the DNA. The affected resonances include the backbone amides of N99, I102, L132, K213, A214 and the side-chain amide of Q134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D and E). Compared to the free-protein spectrum we only miss T211, which cannot be identified. The perturbation induced by the b10 DNA was complete at equimolar concentration with cERCC1. Chemical shift mapping reveals that all perturbations are in the vicinity of the C-terminus of the cERCC1 construct, consistent with the presence of a flexible tag interfering with DNA binding. The DNA-binding region resides at the surface of the structure where the N- and C-termini meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F). The perturbed residues belong to well-defined structure elements. The only positively charged residue we identified (K213) is fully conserved in the ERCC1 proteins and may explain the dependence of DNA binding on salt concentration. All the other affected residues are less conserved than the residues involved in XPA binding. The composition of the affected residues together with the slow exchange behavior suggests a large contribution to the binding by hydrophobic interactions with the DNA bases.</p><p>Summarizing, both the biochemical and the NMR experiments show that the ERCC1 central domain binds to DNA. The DNA-binding site we identified on cERCC1 by the NMR titrations suggests that cERCC1 contacts only a small part of the ssDNA, probably three to four bases. The situation is different in the full-length heterodimer, where other DNA-binding surfaces, such as previously established for the C-terminal ERCC1/XPF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), assist in DNA recognition.</p></sec><sec><title>cERCC1 can bind simultaneously to XPA and ssDNA</title><p>Chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed distinct binding surfaces for ssDNA and XPA, and therefore, it is probable that both can bind simultaneously to cERCC1. We performed EMSA experiments in the presence of an equimolar or 5-fold excess of the HIS-XPA peptide. Addition of XPA did not influence binding of cERCC1 to ssDNA, while the binding affinity of XPA for the cERCC1 domain under these conditions would suggest that the vast majority of cERCC1 is in complex with XPA. We did not observe formation of a slower migrating HIS-GST-cERCC1/ssDNA/XPA super complex, possibly because the increase in mass by the addition of the HIS-XPA peptide was too small to discern (data not shown).</p><p>To independently confirm the formation of a ternary cERCC1/ssDNA/XPA complex, we added the HIS-XPA peptide to the cERCC1-bubble10 protein&#x02013;DNA complex and followed the chemical shift perturbations in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, addition of an equimolar amount of the XPA peptide causes the same amide displacements as in the titration with the free protein. On the contrary, most amides influenced by the DNA binding remain unaffected by the presence of XPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). I102 and N110 were perturbed by both XPA and b10 DNA when the titrations were performed independently. In the ternary complex, however, I102 remains close to the position as in the DNA bound form. Conversely, the side-chain amide of N110, although affected by the DNA, adopts the distinct XPA bound position upon XPA addition. These data strongly indicate the formation of the ternary ERCC1/DNA/XPA complex. DNA and XPA-binding sites are distinct, and the two interactions can happen simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Dual function of cERCC1.

In that sense, human XPF nuclease and human ERCC1 central domains are expected to exhibit the same fold. Moreover, the ERCC1 and XPF HhH<sub>2</sub> domains feature a common architecture and come into tight association exactly in the same way that the HhH<sub>2</sub> domains of both archaeal species do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Therefore, in structural terms the human ERCC1 and XPF proteins share the essential architectural subunits observed in the short XPF homodimer of <italic>A. pernix</italic>. The structural similarities within the XPF family provide additional evidence for the proposed common origin of the human ERCC1 and XPF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Because ERCC1 is absent in archaea, this gene is thought to have been acquired from an ancient XPF gene duplication in the eukaryal lineage. The ERCC1 and XPF genes have subsequently evolved by the process called subfunctionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). This model suggests that after gene duplication, both copies may be reciprocally preserved through the fixation of complementary loss-of-subfunction mutations, which results in a partitioning of the tasks of the ancestral gene. From the functions present in the ancestral XPF protein (archaea), human ERCC1 retained the canonical HhH<sub>2</sub> domain that acts as a DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), while XPF retained the catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Once the separation of the ancestral subfunctions occurred in ERCC1 and XPF genes, only the heterodimeric protein complex could restore the original function. Additionally, due to genetic alterations, the second helix-hairpin-helix motif of human XPF degenerated, yet the fold remained crucial for stabilizing the corresponding intact domain of human ERCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Similarly, the central domain of ERCC1 lost the catalytic activity by sequence drift, but despite adoption of a novel dual function (XPA interaction and DNA binding), the 3D fold was preserved.</p><p>We suggest a mechanistic model for the heterodimeric function based on the model for the homodimeric archaeal homolog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Human ERCC1 corresponds to the archaeal protomer that binds with the HhH<sub>2</sub> domain to the upstream duplex. Human XPF corresponds to the archaeal protomer that recognizes the downstream duplex. Since it cannot make contacts with the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the specificity of the human heterodimer has shifted to splayed-arms substrates consisting of only one duplex. This does not exclude contribution of the XPF HhH domain to ssDNA interactions, as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). We show here that the central domain of ERCC1 is also involved in ssDNA binding. Additional DNA interactions are likely for the nuclease of XPF, analogous to the archaeal case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Furthermore, ssDNA binding by cERCC1 will be stimulated by specific interactions with XPA, already present in the NER pre-incision complex and possibly bound to the DNA via its own DNA-binding site. Most importantly, through these coordinated interactions of the ERCC1 domains the XPF protein will be positioned to cleave the 3&#x02032; protruding strand (limon), thereby retaining the polarity present in the archaeal homodimer. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Models for the function of the archaeal homodimeric XPF (top) and human ERCC1/XPF heterodimer (bottom) constructed from the structure of the XPF homodimer bound to dsDNA (2bgw), the free structure of ERCC1/XPF C-terminal interacting domains (1z00) and the current structure of the ERCC1 central domain (2jpd). For the homodimer, one protomer is shown in a cartoon and the other in a surface representation. Accordingly, for the heterodimer ERCC1 is in a cartoon and XPF in a surface representation.

XPF is the catalytic module but the ERCC1 domains guarantee that the enzymatic activity is targeted properly. The presence of multiple distinct DNA-binding surfaces within the ERCC1/XPF/XPA/RPA repair protein intermediate coordinates cleavage to occur only when the DNA damage is recognized correctly by the NER machinery. The duplication of the ancestral XPF gene within the eukaryal kingdom resulted in an obligate heterodimer through loss of function (with an altered HhH<sub>2</sub> domain of XPF and a degenerated catalytic domain of ERCC1) and adoption of novel functions (ssDNA and XPA binding of cERCC1). This permitted additional quality control mechanisms through a more complicated molecular interaction network, mediated by the novel functional domains, and thereby improving the fidelity of DNA damage repair.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm503_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_gkm503_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to thank Koos Jaspers and Jan Hoeijmakers for providing the full-length vectors of ERCC1 and XPF, and for many fruitful discussions.
