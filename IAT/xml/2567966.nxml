However, the mechanisms by which cigarette smoke causes these varying diseases are not yet fully understood. One key mechanism is believed to be the ability of cigarette smoke to damage cellular DNA leading to the accumulation of somatic cell mutations, which is believed to contribute to the development of cancer and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In this regard, cells can protect genomic integrity by activating pathways of apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Cigarette smoke-induced DNA damage, however, does not always lead to apoptosis or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In this content, DNA repair can also be activated following DNA damage, and the complex mechanisms that regulate whether DNA damage leads to DNA repair or apoptosis have been the subject of many recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported that cigarette smoke induces DNA damage in human bronchial epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts without leading to apoptosis or necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These cells repaired DNA damage and were capable of proliferating and forming colonies when they were subsequently sub-cultured in normal medium. Several signaling pathways may be involved in modulating cell survival or apoptosis in response to cigarette smoke-induced DNA damage. Among these, NF-&#x003ba;B has been reported to play an important role in mediating cell survival. In addition, NF-&#x003ba;B is activated by cigarette smoke <italic>in vitro </italic>in cell culture and <italic>in vivo </italic>in animal models of cigarette smoke exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Thus, the current study was designed to investigate the role of NF-&#x003ba;B in modulating cell survival in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract. We demonstrated that cigarette smoke extract at low concentration (5 and 10%) stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B -DNA binding activity and up-regulated Bcl-XL in HBECs. Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B by curcumin or suppression of p65 by siRNA had no effect on control cell viability, but resulted in increased cell death in cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract. These results indicate that activation of NF-&#x003ba;B following DNA damage plays an important role in mediating whether cell survival or apoptosis ensues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-9609; Rockville, MD). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were acquired from bronchial biopsies of smokers with normal lung function using a previously published method with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] under a protocol approved by the University of Nebraska Human Studies Committee. Both BEAS-2B and HBEC cells were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon; BD Bioscience Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA), which were coated with 0.03 mg/ml collagen (Vitrogen 100, Angiotech BioMaterials, Palo Alto, CA), in a 1:1 mixture of LHC-9/RPMI 1640 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Briefly, one 100 mm long cigarette without filter (R1 Research Grade Cigarette, University of Kentucky; these were obtained prior to their being discontinued by the manufacturer and were stored (4&#x000b0;C) until use.) was combusted with a Mini-Pump Variable Flow (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The smoke was bubbled through 25 ml double distilled water (ddH2O) at a speed of 70 cc/minute till the unburned butt is less than 1 cm long. The resulting suspension was in yellowish color and the optical density (OD) value at 405 nm wave-length was 0.120 &#x000b1; 0.020. This solution was filtered through a 0.22 &#x003bc;m pore filter (Lida Manufacturing Corp., Kenosha, WI) to remove bacteria and large particles. This filtered solution was considered to be 100% CSE and diluted with LHC-D/RPMI 1640 medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] within 30 minutes of preparation to obtain the desired concentration used in each experiment. The LHC-D/RPMI 1640 medium was a 1:1 mixture of LHC-D and RPMI 1640, which contained no serum or growth factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative TUNEL assay</title><p>DNA strand breaks were evaluated quantitatively with a colorimetric kit (Titer TACS, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, CA) that utilizes TUNEL stain in a 96-well format, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates till sub-confluent and treated with desired concentrations of cigarette smoke extract. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% Buffered Formaldehyde for 5 minutes followed by washing once with PBS. The cells were post-fixed with 100% methanol for 20 minutes and washed once with PBS. Cells were then labeled by TUNEL following the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Cells were cultured in 6-well plates till confluent. After treatment with CSE or as a positive control, the DNA topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin (CPT), medium was harvested to collect floating cells and attached cells were detached from the tissue culture dishes with trypsin/EDTA. Both floating and attached cells were then pelleted together and fixed with 70% ethanol at 4&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. After staining with propidium iodide (50 &#x003bc;g/10<sup>6 </sup>cells, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), DNA content/cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Cells with less DNA content than that of G1 cells (sub-G1 peaks or A<sub>0 </sub>cells) were considered apoptotic.</p></sec><sec><title>COMET assay</title><p>Comet assay was performed using the CometAssay&#x02122; Kit (Trevigen, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, cells were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with cigarette smoke extract or camptothecin as described above. Floating and attached cells were harvested, pelleted and re-suspended with cold PBS at 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml. The resulting cell suspension (50 &#x003bc;L) was mixed with 500 &#x003bc;L of LMAgarose and 75 &#x003bc;L of the agarose/cells was pipetted over the sample area of the COMET Slides. The samples were lysed, electrophoresed and stained following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then viewed with an epifluorescence microscopy (NIKON Eclipse E800) and photographed with a digital camera (OPTRONICS) under 200&#x000d7; magnification.

The cell lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and the precipitates were discarded. Protein concentrations in supernatants were determined by a protein dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were then subjected to immunoblot analysis. After heating for 3 minutes at 95&#x000b0;C, 10 &#x003bc;g of total protein was mixed with 2&#x000d7; sample buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCL, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 2% b-mercaptoethanol) and loaded into each well before performing electrophoresis with the Mini-protein 3 Cell System<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in transfer buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM glycine, 20% methanol) at 20 V for 40 minutes with the semi-dry electrophoretic transfer system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane was blocked with 5% dry-milk in PBS-Tween at room temperature for 1 hour and then exposed to primary antibodies at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Target proteins were subsequently detected using horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, England).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)</title><p>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with a kit (Panomics, Inc, Redwood city, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, nuclear extract (5 &#x003bc;g) was incubated with 10 ng biotin-labeled NF-&#x003ba;B (p65) probe. For the "cold probe" assay, 20 ng of unlabeled (cold) NF-kB probe was mixed with sample 5 minuets before adding 10 ng biotin-labeled NF-kB probe (cold vs labeled probe ratio was 2:1). Protein-DNA complexes were then resolved by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).

Cell death or survival was then evaluated by three different methods including LIVE/DEAD staining, COMET assay and clonogenic assay. Only the combination of p65-siRNA suppression and smoke exposure resulted in major cytotoxicity. In the presence of 10%CSE, the cells lacking p65 started to detach at 3&#x02013;4 hrs after exposure to cigarette smoke and nearly all of the cells were detached from the culture dish after 24 hours exposure. In contrast, only a few cells in the control-siRNA treated group detached in response to cigarette smoke exposure. LIVE/DEAD staining demonstrated that very few cells were dead (red nuclei) in the non-targeting siRNA transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, 3.5 &#x000b1; 0.3%), in the cells of p65-siRNA transfected without cigarette smoke exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, 7.0 &#x000b1; 1.1%) or in non-targeting siRNA transfected cells exposed to 10% cigarette smoke (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, 2.4 &#x000b1; 1.0%). In contrast, nearly half of the cells were dead in the cells transfected with p65-siRNA and exposed to cigarette smoke extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, 32.5 &#x000b1; 1.8%, p &#x0003c; 0.01 compared to control siRNA transfected cells without exposure to cigarette smoke extract), which was similar to the cells exposed to camptothecin (data not shown). Consistent with LIVE/DEAD cytotoxicity assay, p65-depleted cells underwent severe DNA damage and apoptotic death when they were exposed to cigarette smoke as evidenced by COMET assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

The inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by a pharmacologic inhibitor (curcumin) or suppression of p65 by siRNA results in a significant increase in apoptotic cell death in response to cigarette smoke exposure, indicating NF-&#x003ba;B regulates cell survival of human bronchial epithelial cells following cigarette smoke-induced DNA damage.</p><p>Cigarette smoke contains over six thousand chemical compounds that are delivered to the lungs as a gas, as an aerosol or as particles. Many of these toxins can cause DNA damage or strand breakage. In response to DNA damage, cells can either repair the damage or can protect the integrity of the genome by activation of pathways leading to programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Should apoptosis fail to remove cells with irreversibly damaged DNA, this may result in epigenetic changes or somatic cell mutation, which could lead to altered tissue function and, potentially, to the development of cancer or other disease. Here, we report that cigarette smoke induces not only DNA damage, but also cell cycle arrest in S phase. These cells, however, did not undergo apoptosis. In contrast, the cells exposed to cigarette smoke recovered following removal of the cigarette smoke and could proliferate and form colonies. Similar findings have been reported by Bayram et al in diesel exhaust particle exposed human lung epithelial cells and by Narayan et al in cigarette smoke exposed human breast epithelial cells <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Cell cycle arrest allows more time for DNA repair following DNA damage. Timely progression of cell cycles is regulated by a series of specific check-point kinase (CHK1, CHK2), cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and their inhibitors (cdkIs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The most potent cdkIs are p21, p27, p57 and p16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Activation of these cdkIs leads to G1/S phase cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, suppression or deficiency of p21 protein leads the cells to undergo apoptosis through extensive cytochrome c release and caspase activation in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It has been reported that cells with activated NF-kB in response to DNA damage had prolonged cell cycle arrest time followed by cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In contrast, cells that failed to activate NF-kB underwent transient cell cycle arrest and extensive cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, induction of p21 in the arrested cells was NF-kB dependent and suppression of p21 by siRNA reduced NF-kB-mediated cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. However, whether p21 also regulates cell cycle arrest in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to cigarette smoke-induced DNA damage remains to be determined.</p><p>Whether a cell undergoes apoptosis or survival following DNA damage is controlled by a complex interaction of many signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Among these, NF-&#x003ba;B is believed to play an important role in regulating cell survival by up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B is a family of transcription factors that can form either homo- or heterodimers. Five distinct chains (RelA (p65), RelB, cRel, p50/p105, p52/100) comprising NF-&#x003ba;B have been described, providing considerable heterogeneity. Latent forms are retained in the cytoplasm bound to a class of inhibitory proteins termed I&#x003ba;Bs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A large number of stimuli are capable of activating a family of kinases termed I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates I&#x003ba;B, and leads to its degradation. This results in unbound NF-&#x003ba;B that is then free to enter the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Many inflammatory stimuli and injurious insults, including cigarette smoke, can activate NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], we found that cigarette smoke extract stimulates NF-&#x003ba;B DNA binding activity in human bronchial epithelial cells.</p><p>We have previously reported that cigarette smoke extract induces DNA damage without leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and that the IL-6/STAT3 pathway plays a role in mediating cell survival in response to cigarette smoke exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, we extend these previous studies by demonstrating that inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by curcumin or suppression of p65 by siRNA also results in increased cell death of bronchial epithelial cells in response to cigarette smoke extract. This indicates that NF-&#x003ba;B is also involved in regulating cell survival following cigarette smoke-induced DNA damage. The downstream mechanisms by which NF-&#x003ba;B mediates cell survival remains to be further defined. However, like IL-6/STAT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], NF-&#x003ba;B can modulate the production of a number of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, especially, Bcl-XL. This suggests that multiple pathways that may interact by regulating the network of proteins that in turn modulate apoptosis are required to sustain cell survival in the face of DNA damage induced by cigarette smoke.</p><p>In the current study, the pharmacologic inhibitor curcumin was used to inhibit NF-&#x003ba;B signaling. Curcumin [1,7-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione] is the major bioactive compound in turmeric (Curcuma longa) with reported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and anti-mutagenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity by curcumin sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy, inhibits cell growth, and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consistent with this, our data demonstrate that curcumin sensitizes bronchial epithelial cells to undergo apoptotic death in response to a low concentration of cigarette smoke extract that would otherwise cause DNA damage without cell death and that this effect is dependent on NF-&#x003ba;B activity.</p><p>Curcumin, however, inhibits not only NF-&#x003ba;B, but also other transcription factors including AP-1 and STATs, and kinases such as protein kinases and MAPKs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to curcumin, an RNAi strategy specifically targeting p65 was also used in the current study. Suppression of p65 by RNAi has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In the current study, we demonstrated that p65-siRNA very efficiently and specifically suppressed p65 production without affecting non-targeted STAT3, p50 and &#x003b2;-actin in human bronchial epithelial cells. Suppression of p65 by RNAi <italic>per se </italic>does not alter cell viability or the ability of cells to proliferate. Cell death only occurred when the cells lacking p65 were exposed to cigarette smoke, indicating p65 is required for protection of the cells from cigarette smoke insult.</p><p>It has been reported that NF-kB modulates cell survival or death in many cell types through regulating expression of apoptosis associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Constitutive activation of NF-kB contributes to the survival of cancer cells while inhibition of NF-kB sensitizing the cells to undergo apoptosis in response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In the current study, we demonstrated that an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-XL, was significantly up-regulated by cigarette smoke in HBECs and this was abolished by introduction of p65 siRNA prior to cigarette smoke exposure. These results suggest that NF-kB regulates HBEC survival, at least in part, through up-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-XL. Cell survival, however, depends on a balance of many factors, and it seems likely that NF-kB will modulate factors other than Bcl-XL.</p><p>Effect of cigarette smoke on human being is determined by many factors such as type of cigarette, manner of smoking and history of smoking. In the current study, an <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture model was used to study the effect of cigarette smoke on human airway cells. This <italic>in vitro </italic>cell culture model has its limitations as it differs from <italic>in vivo </italic>conditions. In this study, the cells were in submerged culture condition and were exposed to CSE in tissue culture media without protein supplementation. It is likely that the <italic>in vivo </italic>exposure of cells to toxins in inhaled smoke will differ, both due to the different concentrations of toxins and to the modulatory effects of proteins and other factors present in the cellular milieu. Despite these limitations, however, <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments with the design utilized in the current study have a long history of providing useful information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In this regard, the calculated concentration of acrolein in our fresh medium (2.16 &#x000d7; 10&#x02013;5 M) is similar to that reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] and to that inhibits lung fibroblasts repair functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, the key <italic>in vitro </italic>findings of the current study, that NF-&#x003ba;B mediates bronchial epithelial cell survival following DNA damage by cigarette smoke exposure provides evidence for a potential mechanism by which cigarette smoke may cause epigenetic changes or somatic cell mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The current study demonstrates that cigarette smoke extract not only induces DNA damage and cell cycle arrest without leading to apoptosis, but also stimulates NF-&#x003ba;B -DNA binding activity and up-regulates Bcl-XL, and that NF-kB is required for CSE induced inhibition of apoptosis through Bcl-XL up-regulation. By damaging DNA and simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis through NF-kB signaling pathway, cigarette smoke may be able to cause either epigenetic changes or somatic cell mutation. Either of these could lead to altered cellular function and could contribute to chronic diseases such as cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CPT: Camptothecin; CSE: Cigarette smoke extract; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; HBEC: human bronchial epithelial cells; TUNEL: terminal dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>XL, SR- design experiment, write and revise manuscript.
