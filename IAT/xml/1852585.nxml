It is likely that significant insights into embryo development will emerge from the characterisation of novel types of genes. Yet most current genome annotation methods rely heavily on comparisons with already-known gene sequences, so genes with previously uncharacterised structures and functions can be missed. Here we present the characterisation of one of these novel genes, <italic>tarsal-less</italic>. <italic>tarsal-less</italic> has two unusual features: it contains more than one coding unit, a structure more similar to some bacterial genes; and it codes for small peptides rather than proteins. In fact, these peptides represent the smallest gene products known to date. Functional analysis of this gene in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> shows that it has important functions throughout development, including tissue morphogenesis and pattern formation. We identify genes similar to <italic>tarsal-less</italic> in other species, and thus define a <italic>tarsal-less</italic>&#x02013;related gene family.

Classical genetic approaches have been complemented by systematic searches for new genes and their functions, resulting in an exponential increase of information. This new knowledge has filtered to related areas such as cell biology, medical research, and increasingly, evolution and population genetics. However, there still remain significant gaps in our understanding, not only of how different aspects of development such as patterning, morphogenesis, and differentiation are organised and implemented at the cellular level, but also in how these different aspects are coordinated. One exciting possibility is that new types of genes with new coding arrangements await discovery and characterisation. The number of known key regulatory genes and signalling proteins remains small, in the region of the hundreds, but sequenced and annotated genomes, including the human genome, still contain thousands of genes and transcripts without known function or sequence similarity to other genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d; or are deemed RNA or noncoding genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> leg offers a good system in which to pursue this analysis further. Fly legs have a high density of pattern elements and a simple developmental topology, with a single main axis of patterning and growth, the PD axis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The legs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> develop from presumptive organs called imaginal discs, and the morphogenesis of these discs, in particular their acquisition of a stereotyped set of folds that prefigure the morphology of the final appendage, is coordinated with patterning and growth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our search for these links led us to the isolation and characterisation of a new <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene that we call <italic>tarsal-less (tal)</italic>. This gene expresses a 1.5-kilobase (Kb) transcript that had been classified as putatively noncoding &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. It contains several open reading frames (ORFs) smaller than 50 amino acids (aa) and thus is putatively polycistronic. Our analysis shows that surprisingly, the peptides translated from ORFs of just 11 aa mediate the function of the gene. Therefore <italic>tal</italic> has two novel features for eukaryotic coding genes: the direct translation of short, unprocessed peptides with full biological function, and their tandem arrangement in a polycistronic messenger. We identify <italic>tal</italic> homologous genes in other species and observe that they define a new, noncanonical gene family of ancient origin. We expect that a combination of new bioinformatics and proteomics methods tailored to the search of peptides and small ORFs (smORFs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, plus a reassessment of classical data, will identify and characterise more new coding genes with similarly important functions in these and other areas of biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Isolation and Characterisation of the <italic>tarsal-less</italic> Gene</title><p>We identified the <italic>tal</italic> gene through a spontaneous mutant <italic>(tal<sup>1</sup>)</italic> with defective legs in which the tarsal segments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; do not develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

There is no gene prediction in this region, but there is a noncoding cDNA, LD11162 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, and two lethal P element inserts, S011041 and KG1680, located 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; respectively to LD11162 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

These are regulatory mutants that affect only the imaginal disc function. Mobilisation of both KG1680 and S011041 insertions produced a number of alleles that all define a single complementation group.

We sequenced one of these, LP10384, that is identical to LD11162. In addition, a single transcript of 1.5 kb corresponding to this cDNA has been identified by Northern blots &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; and reverse-transcriptase PCR (unpublished data). The expression of this transcript is similar to the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter S011041 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">2</xref>B), is coincident with the regions affected in <italic>tal</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">1</xref>C), and is lost in <italic>ta1</italic> mutants (unpublished data). To prove definitely that this transcript encodes the function of the <italic>tal</italic> gene, we performed a rescue experiment. The KG1680 insert was replaced by a Gal4 insert &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. The resulting Gal4 line <italic>(P&#x0007b;GaWB&#x0007d;tal<sup>KG</sup>,</italic> subsequently referred to as <italic>tal-Gal4)</italic> is a regulatory viable allele similar to <italic>tal<sup>1</sup></italic> and the KG1680 insertion, and produces a <italic>tal</italic> phenotype in legs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">1</xref>D) while simultaneously driving the expression of upstream activating sequence (UAS) constructs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; in the <italic>tal</italic> pattern. We generated a construct with the full-length LP10384 cDNA downstream of a UAS promoter <italic>(UAS-tal)</italic> and tried to rescue mutant animals of the genotype <italic>tal-Gal4/tal<sup>S68</sup></italic> by introducing this <italic>UAS-tal</italic> construct.

This rescue proves that the <italic>tal</italic> function is encoded by LP10384, which represents the <italic>tal</italic> RNA. Moreover, ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-tal</italic> produces mutant phenotypes that are consistent with <italic>tal</italic> being a tarsal determinant: transformation of distal tibia and fusion to tarsi, where <italic>tal</italic> is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>F).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Functions of <italic>tal</italic> in Development</title><p><italic>tal</italic> expression in the leg has the interesting feature of being transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">2</xref>C). The time of <italic>tal</italic> expression (from about 80 to 96 h after egg laying &#x0005b;AEL&#x0005d;) coincides with the specification of the tarsal region by the activation of specific genes in ring patterns similar to that of <italic>tal</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

In contrast, loss or excess of function of <italic>rn</italic> (induced with a <italic>UAS-rn</italic> construct) has no effect on <italic>tal</italic> expression (unpublished data). These results show that the <italic>rn</italic> gene is a downstream target of <italic>tal</italic>.</p><p>Further functions of <italic>tal</italic> are apparent. In <italic>tal</italic> mutants, the whole tarsal region is missing, a stronger phenotype than that produced by <italic>rn</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and anti-Caspase 3 staining reveals that this is not produced by cell death (unpublished data). <italic>tal</italic> expression precedes and then straddles the tarsal furrow within which the tarsal segments develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">Figures 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">2</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g003">3</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>tal</italic> mutant discs, the tarsal fold does not form further than a superficial constriction, subsequent tarsal folds do not form, and the tarsal region does not grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Reciprocally, ectopic expression of <italic>tal</italic> induces the appearance of ectopic folds in legs (unpublished data). These morphogenetic phenotypes are not produced by changes of <italic>rn</italic> expression on its own &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;, and the lack of folding is not rescued by inducing expression of <italic>rn</italic> in <italic>tal</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>tal</italic> null alleles are embryonic lethal. <italic>tal</italic> expression in the developing embryo is initially segmental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>A; see also <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fruitfly.org">http://www.fruitfly.org</ext-link>), followed by a later and more complex pattern of expression in many organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">4</xref>D). The embryonic mutant phenotypes include broken trachea, loss of cephalopharyngeal skeleton, abnormal posterior spiracles, and lack of denticle belts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>E&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">4</xref>H). These are the regions where <italic>tal</italic> is expressed from stage 13 until the end of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">4</xref>D). This phenotype is identical to a deletion of the entire 87F13&#x02013;15 region, and is not enhanced by removing any putative maternal contribution in germ-line clones (unpublished data). Ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-tal</italic> produces reciprocal mutant phenotypes, such as extra sclerotised elements in the cephalopharyngeal skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>I).</p><p>Despite the early segmental pattern of expression, <italic>tal</italic> mutants do not show any segmentation or homeotic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050106-sg002">S2</xref>). Therefore, the early segmental expression seems to be only a transient state to establish expression in the precursors of the tracheal system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Although the mutant epidermis lacks denticle belts, segment-specific epidermal sensory organs are present, and segments are formed. Expression of markers such as <italic>wingless</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>J), <italic>Distal-less,</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050106-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) is normal. The late expression of <italic>wingless</italic> is not expanded and thus is not responsible for the observed loss of denticles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, <italic>tal</italic> function is independent of <italic>shaven-baby</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref>K) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

The type-A ORFs (1A, 2A, 3A, and AA) include a conserved LDPTGXY motif of 7 aa, and this motif is very strongly conserved in the cDNA of homologous genes that we have identified in other arthropods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050106-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). ORF 1A and 2A encode an identical 11-aa peptide. ORF 3A encodes another 11-aa peptide very similar to 1A. ORF AA encodes a 32-aa peptide whose N- and C-termini each contain a LDPTGXY motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). ORF-B encodes a 49-aa peptide without known domains other than a poly-Arg stretch and is somehow weakly conserved in other insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050106-sg001">S1</xref>).</p><p>The conservation of the aa sequences in other species suggests, but does not prove, the translation of these smORFs.

Therefore, we next concentrated on dissecting the role of the ORF sequences in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cDNA. A deletion construct <italic>(AB)</italic> leaving only a type-A ORF plus ORF-B is still fully functional. It can rescue <italic>tal</italic> mutants, and it produces the same ectopic effects as full-length <italic>tal</italic>. Construct <italic>delA</italic> deletes the type-A ORF and is just 32 base pairs (bp) shorter than <italic>AB,</italic> but has lost all functionality, suggesting that the type-A ORF is key for the <italic>tal</italic> function, and ORF-B is dispensable. It could be argued that the translation initiation context of ORF-B is too weak and that its expression requires an upstream functional type-A ORF. However, the construct <italic>ATG-B,</italic> in which we have put ORF-B under the control of the Tal1A initiation context, is still unable to reproduce the <italic>tal</italic> rescue or ectopic effects. Reciprocally, two constructs in which potential translation of ORF-B has been abolished, by either deleting it <italic>(delB)</italic> or by mutating its start codon <italic>(NoB),</italic> are fully functional, rescue <italic>tal</italic> mutants, and produce the same ectopic effects as full-length <italic>UAS-tal,</italic> including activation of <italic>rn</italic> expression (unpublished data). Finally, a construct containing only one type-A ORF <italic>(1A)</italic> is fully functional, and a one-nucleotide insertion that produces a frameshift <italic>(1A-FS)</italic> abolishes its functions.</p><p>Altogether, these results show that (1) an 11-aa type-A ORF provides <italic>tal</italic> function, and (2) ORF-B has no developmental function.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Polycistronic Translation of <italic>tal</italic> RNA</title><p>These functional results indicate that <italic>tal</italic> function resides in the type-A ORFs, and the results with constructs <italic>Bm-wds, 1A,</italic> and <italic>1A-FS</italic> seem to exclude a model of <italic>tal</italic> function as a noncoding RNA. Thus we sought direct proof of <italic>tal</italic> translation.</p><p>The small size of the putative <italic>tal</italic> peptides makes them difficult to detect directly. In order to facilitate their detection in in vitro and in vivo experiments, we have tagged them by introducing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence, minus the start and stop codons, in frame and within each of the type-A ORFs and the ORF-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Thus, the resulting fusion constructs still have the <italic>tal</italic> sequences relevant for translation, including the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; UTRs, the initiation consensi, and start codons. Construct <italic>1A-GFP</italic> contains the GFP sequence within the type-A ORF of the <italic>AB</italic> construct, which was functional and contains the 1A translation initiation environment. <italic>2A-GFP, 3A-GFP, AA-GFP,</italic> and <italic>B-GFP</italic> contain each GFP fusion within a full-length <italic>tal</italic> cDNA.

In all cases, we can discard the interpretation that the results are due to translation from a second methionine in the GFP sequence, not only because of the size of the fusion products obtained, but also because these putative peptides would lack the N-terminal sequences that are essential for GFP fluorescence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Thus, our results show that the <italic>tal</italic> gene is coding, and polycistronic, because several peptides can be synthesised from a single RNA species.

Although the <italic>tal</italic> cDNA contains several copies of the type-A ORFs related by a common LDPTGXY domain, a construct containing just one of them is fully functional. Small peptides are known to have important biological functions, most clearly in endocrine and neural communication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, but in all described cases, these peptides are mature, cleaved products of a longer ORF. The originality of the <italic>tal</italic> gene is thus 2-fold. First, smORFs of just 33 nucleotides are fully functional and capable of translation. Second, the carefully regulated local expression of these peptides in complex patterns (as opposed to a systemic release) has important developmental functions. Our genetic and molecular analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and unpublished data) show that the <italic>tal</italic> genomic region contains specific regulatory sequences spread out over a minimum of 25 Kb.</p><sec id="s3a"><title><italic>tal</italic> Acts during Patterning and Morphogenesis</title><p>We notice that <italic>tal</italic> expression and function are often associated with tissues undergoing changes of shape such as folding and invagination.

On the one hand, the transient ring of <italic>tal</italic> expression appears in the precise time and place to control tarsal patterning, by promoting <italic>rn</italic> expression and by being involved in further regulatory interactions with other leg-patterning genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g002">Figure 2</xref> and unpublished data). On the other hand, <italic>tal</italic> controls folding of the leg tissue independently of these effects. In the wild-type leg imaginal discs, a complex morphogenetic process involving the appearance of extra folds within the tarsal furrow, in correlation with leg growth, is apparent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In <italic>tal</italic> mutants, this morphogenetic process is compromised, whereas in excess-of-function experiments, ectopic expression of <italic>tal</italic> induces the appearance of ectopic folds in legs. In the mutant discs, cells undergo an apico-basal constriction, but the tarsal furrow never widens into a fold; the appearance of further tarsal sub-folds is precluded, and the presumptive tarsal region does not grow. In the embryo, <italic>tal</italic> expression is found in tissues of ectodermal origin that undergo an invagination without compromising their epithelial organisation, such as the foregut (and later on in its derivatives, the proventriculus and the pharynx), the hindgut, the developing trachea, and the spiracles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. In mutant embryos, head involution is slow, the pharynx is short and misplaced, and tracheal fusion is incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref> and unpublished data). The loss of denticles in the epidermis does not seem based on alterations of the segmental patterning cascade, but on cell morphology defects that do not involve defects in apico-basal cell polarity or epidermal integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g004">Figure 4</xref> and unpublished data). Altogether, these results suggest that <italic>tal</italic> is required for the control of cell movements during tissue morphogenesis. Further research beyond the scope of this initial study should identify the cellular and molecular targets of this function.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>An 11-aa Peptide Defines a New Polycistronic Gene Family</title><p>Our results provide experimental evidence for function and translation of the type-A ORFs. These include the in vitro and in vivo translation assays, functional rescues, and sequence analysis. Our results therefore imply that <italic>tal</italic> is polycistronic, because several ORFs can be translated from a single RNA molecule. The question arises of how this can be accomplished in an eukaryotic gene, but the literature provides a possible mechanism. Polycistronic genes are known in eukaryotes including <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b038">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, and so in principle, all <italic>tal</italic> ORFs could be potentially translated simultaneously. Experimental evidence supports three models for translation of polycistronic messengers in eukaryotes, namely &#x0201c;internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES),&#x0201d; &#x0201c;leaky scanning,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;reinitiation&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. There are clear rules backed by experimental data concerning the DNA sequences and transcript structure involved in each of these models. The <italic>tal</italic> RNA sequence seems to exclude both the IRES and the leaky scanning possibilities. There is not enough space for IRES between the <italic>tal</italic> ORFs, and the initiation consensi are stronger in the 5&#x02032; ORFs than in the 3&#x02032; ones, the opposite of conditions favourable for leaky scanning. However, polycistronic translation of type-A ORFs in the <italic>tal</italic> transcript is possible under the reinitiation model because their spacing is between 40 and 200 bp, and the short type-A ORFs (1A to 3A) are much shorter than 35 aa. In all cases studied, the presence of 5&#x02032; ORFs has a dramatic impact on the rate of translation of the 3&#x02032; ones, leading in certain conditions, to total blockage of 3&#x02032; translation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. Accordingly, our in vitro translation experiment shows a diminishing amount of protein arising from each ORF, with highest levels produced by 1A, and lowest by AA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). We would expect, by virtue of its conserved common domain, that these translated type-A peptides will share the same functions. The presence of repeated or similar ORFs is perhaps a device to ensure enough translation of LDPTGXY-containing peptides. This hypothesis coincides with the results of our structure/function analysis, which shows that a single artificial type-A ORF suffices to provide <italic>tal</italic> function.</p><p>These conclusions are further corroborated by our discovery of <italic>tal</italic> homologous genes in other insects. These genes contain repeated copies of type-A ORFs in varying number from two (crustaceans and primitive insects) to 11 <italic>(Bombyx mori),</italic> and an evolutionary trend towards accumulation of more type-A ORFs, including duplications of the entire gene, is apparent. The aa sequence of these type-A ORFs is very strongly conserved in their core domain LDPTGXY. The spacing between ORFs is most compatible with the reinitiation model described above. Not only sequence, but also functionality is conserved, as indicated by the rescue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants with a <italic>Bombyx</italic> cDNA. The resilience and long age of the evolutionary history of this gene family suggest, not a recently evolved curiosity of some insects, but a peptide with ancestral and current importance.</p><p>All available data suggest that the weakly conserved ORF-B is spurious or nonfunctional. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> our functional analysis fails to identify any essential function for ORF-B, and both our in vitro and in vivo studies fail to detect its translation. This is in agreement with the fact that the 5&#x02032; presence of several type-A ORFs with strong initiation contexts, allied to the weakness of the context for ORF-B, does not favour the translation of ORF-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, the size of the ORF AA is 32 aa, near the limit of 35 aa required for continued downstream reinitiation at ORF-B. In agreement with this sequence analysis, ectopic expression of the <italic>Bombyx Bm-wds</italic> construct containing an ORF-B in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not produce any additional phenotypes when compared to those produced by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> constructs, indicating that the <italic>Bombyx</italic> ORF-B is not functional either. We would surmise that the weak conservation of ORF-B sequences is either related to some functional requirement (other than translation) for the nucleotide sequence in the region of the transcript, or pure chance.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The <italic>mlpt</italic> Gene in <italic>Tribolium</italic></title><p>The conservation of aa sequences has been suggested as evidence for the translation of three type-A ORFs and one ORF-B in a homologous gene called <italic>milles-pattes (mlpt)</italic> found in the flour beetle <named-content content-type="genus-species">Tribolium castaneum</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. These ORFs are of a similar small size as in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> but again such aa conservation is not conclusive evidence. In the absence of a biochemical and functional analysis of these different ORFs like the one we present here, it is difficult to guess which ORFs are translated and mediate the function of <italic>mlpt</italic>. The ORF-B of <italic>mlpt</italic> has been deemed the main functional element of the gene due to its longer length &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, but in fact, the available data belie this interpretation and favour our own conclusion of ORF-B as nonfunctional. The ORF-B of <italic>mlpt</italic> has no Kozak consensus at all, and its start codon overlaps with the stop codon of the previous 5&#x02032; type-A ORF, a situation that seems most unlikely to lead to ORF-B translation, even by a mechanism of readthrough as postulated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Readthrough and ribosome codon slippage always proceed by skipping bases forward, rather than backwards as would be needed here. Further, ORF-B aa conservation is rather weak.

In addition, our analysis shows that <italic>tal</italic> genes without ORF-B exist, and in fact, an ORF-B is only present in some genes from holometabolous insects.</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of the function of the whole <italic>mlpt</italic> transcript identifies several functions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; that seem homologous to the one we have identified in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> in particular the tarsal-promoting function, and a requirement in the tracheal system. However, Savard et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050106-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; also identify a &#x0201c;gap&#x0201d; and homeotic segmentation phenotypes that our expression and functional data results show to be absent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050106-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050106-sg002">S2</xref>).

For the <italic>AA-GFP,</italic> a SpeI site was introduced in the middle of the ORF AA, between the two conserved LDPTGXY motifs, by directed mutagenesis, then linearised, and the GFP sequence flanked by SpeI adaptors was introduced in frame in LP10384. For the B-GFP construct, a similar strategy was employed, by introducing a KpnI site in ORF-B. For the generation of transgenic flies or transfection into S2R&#x0002b; cells, these constructs were excised by double digestion with EcoRI and XhoI, and directionally cloned into pPUASt.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>In vitro transcription and translation experiments.</title><p>These were carried out using the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation reticulocyte system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States).
