Yth1 was previously shown to interact with pre-mRNA and with two CPF subunits, Brr5&#x0002f;Ysh1 and the polyadenylation-specific Fip1, and to act in both steps of mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing. In the present study, we have identified new domains involved in each interaction and have analyzed the consequences of mutating these regions on Yth1 function <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. We have found that the essential fourth zinc finger (ZF4) of Yth1 is critical for interaction with Fip1 and RNA, but not for cleavage, and a single point mutation in ZF4 impairs only polyadenylation. Deletion of the essential N-terminal region that includes the ZF1 or deletion of ZF4 weakened the interaction with Brr5 <italic>in vitro</italic>. <italic>In vitro</italic> assays showed that the N-terminus is necessary for both processing steps. Of particular importance, we find that the binding of Fip1 to Yth1 blocks the RNA&#x02013;Yth1 interaction, and that this inhibition requires the Yth1-interacting domain on Fip1. Our results suggest a role for Yth1 not only in the execution of cleavage and poly(A) addition, but also in the transition from one step to the other.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, accurate processing of the 3&#x02032; ends of primary transcripts is an essential step that promotes transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c3">3</xref>) and transport of mRNA from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c6">6</xref>). Cells are able to change the type and amount of mRNA derived from many genes by regulation of this step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c8">8</xref>). The resulting poly(A) tail is also important for optimal translation and for determining mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The processing of the 3&#x02032; end of the primary transcripts consists of a tightly coupled two-step reaction involving site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage and poly(A) addition onto the upstream cleaved product. This reaction requires <italic>cis</italic>-acting signal sequences on the RNA and <italic>trans</italic>-acting protein com ponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c14">14</xref>). Uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c16">16</xref>) led to the biochemical identification of factors involved in either one or both steps of the process. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, fractionation of whole cell extracts has identified five functionally distinct activities involved in cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c18">18</xref>). Cleavage requires Cleavage Factor I (CF I) and Cleavage Factor II (CF II), while tail synthesis requires poly(A) polymerase (Pap1), CF I, CF II, Polyadenylation Factor I (PF I), and poly(A) binding protein (Pab1). CF I consists of five subunits, Rna14, Rna15, Pcf11, Clp1 and Hrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c21">21</xref>). PF I can also be isolated as part of a larger complex that contains CF II components, and has been designated Cleavage Polyadenylation Factor (CPF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c22">22</xref>). CPF includes Pap1, Fip1, Pta1, Mpe1, Pfs2, Cft1&#x0002f;Yhh1, Cft2&#x0002f;Ydh1, Brr5&#x0002f;Ysh1, Yth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c23">23</xref>) and additional uncharacterized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c24">24</xref>). A subcomplex consisting of Cft1, Cft2, Brr5 and Pta1 was found to carry out CF II activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c26">26</xref>). Homologs for many of the CF I and CPF subunits have been found in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>), illustrating the conserved nature of this process.</p><p>In yeast, at least four <italic>cis</italic>-acting signals are important for mRNA 3&#x02032; end processing: a UA-rich element found at a variable distance upstream of the poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c30">30</xref>), an A-rich element located &#x0223c;20 nt upstream of the poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c32">32</xref>), U-rich sequences around the poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c34">34</xref>) and the poly(A) site, whose sequence is most frequently Py(A)<sub>n</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c36">36</xref>). The 3&#x02032; processing complex must contain RNA binding subunits that recognize these individual signals and thus direct the protein complex to a pre-mRNA for cleavage at the poly(A) site. In CF I, these are Hrp1, which interacts with the UA-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c40">40</xref>), and Rna15, which binds specifically to the A-rich element when Hrp1 and Rna14 are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c40">40</xref>). Among CPF subunits, at least three proteins (Cft1, Cft2 and Yth1) have RNA-binding properties. UV cross-linking experiments with purified CF II showed that Cft2 is cross-linked to <italic>GAL7</italic> mRNA only when the UA-rich element is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c25">25</xref>). RNase H protection assays demonstrated that the CPF complex, as well as Cft1, Cft2 and Yth1 individually, interacts with the region around the <italic>CYC1</italic> RNA poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c43">43</xref>).</p><p>As our knowledge of eukaryotic cleavage&#x0002f;polyadenylation factors increases, further understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying this essential process will require a thorough dissection of how the interactions of these factors with each other and with substrate promote cleavage, the transition from a cleavage to a polyadenylation complex, and processive synthesis of a correctly sized poly(A) tail. In this study, we focus such an analysis on Yth1, a 24 kDa subunit of CPF known to be essential for both cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>). Yth1 and its mammalian homolog CPSF-30 contain a well conserved central section of five CCCH zinc fingers, with regions of divergent sequence on either side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>). Members of the rare CCCH zinc finger family have in common two or more repeats of a motif consisting of Cys and His residues in the form CX<sub>8</sub>CX<sub>5</sub>CX<sub>3</sub>H. Proteins bearing this motif have roles in RNA binding, RNA localization and RNA stability in a wide variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c48">48</xref>). Zinc fingers in general have been implicated not only in nucleic acid binding but also in protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c50">50</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the interaction of Yth1 and RNA described above, Yth1 interacts with Fip1, whose binding to Pap1 regulates this enzyme&#x02019;s activity and connects it to the processing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c51">51</xref>). Yth1 also associates with Brr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>), a CPF subunit necessary for both steps of processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c27">27</xref>). The structure of Yth1 suggests that it is organized into seven discrete domains that might contribute in unique ways to Yth1 function. Experimental evidence has begun to support this conclusion. Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) showed that a deletion of the C-terminus that includes most of ZF5 (yth1-1) weakened the interaction with Fip1 and abrogated polyadenylation. However, mutation of a highly conserved residue in ZF2 (yth1-4) demonstrated that Yth1 was important for both cleavage and polyadenylation. This mutation preserved Fip1 binding but interfered with the interaction with RNA and the rest of CPF. In addition, a mutation of H142N in ZF4 (yth1-5) caused shorter poly(A) tails but had no effect on cleavage.</p><p>In this study, we create mutations throughout the protein to identify functions for the other Yth1 domains and to clarify the roles of ZF4 and the C-terminus. For example, we have found that ZF2 and ZF4 are both essential for RNA interaction and deletion of either one causes lethality. However, further analysis shows that these two zinc fingers have different functions. Yth1 lacking ZF2 cannot rescue the <italic>in vitro</italic> cleavage defect of a <italic>yth1-4</italic> mutant extract. In contrast, Yth1 without ZF4 can function in cleavage, but shows no interaction with Fip1, a protein essential for poly(A) addition. Moreover, we find that Fip1 inhibits the interaction between Yth1 and RNA. Our results suggest that rearrangement of the post-cleavage complex to one active for polyadenylation might involve a switch in which ZF4 binds Fip1 instead of RNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p>The <italic>YTH1</italic> knockout strain SB7 carrying the <italic>yth1-1</italic> allele was a kind gift from Drs Silvia M.

There is a large amount of data indicating that such a deletion analysis of Yth1 would be a valid approach to understand Yth1 function. Numerous structural studies of DNA-binding zinc finger proteins have shown that each zinc finger motif forms a small, functional, independently folded mini-domain, and that the mode of DNA recognition is principally a one-to-one interaction between amino acids of the recognition helix and bases of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c56">56</xref>). Deletion analysis of wig-1 (p53-induced mouse zinc finger protein) showed that the first zinc finger is essential for binding to double-stranded RNA, whereas zinc fingers 2 and 3 are dispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c57">57</xref>). In a similar approach, it was found that zinc fingers 2&#x02013;4 of MTF-1 (metal response element-binding transcription factor-1) are involved in DNA binding, whereas the first zinc finger appears to function as a metal-sensing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c58">58</xref>). As the following results demonstrate, each Yth1 zinc finger deletion retained one or more of the known activities of Yth1, suggesting that the mutant proteins are folding properly. In addition to function of the different zinc fingers, we were interested in whether the unique regions of either end of Yth1 were important for Yth1 function.</p><p>To determine which regions of Yth1 are necessary for cell viability, we replaced the wild-type <italic>YTH1</italic> gene with the deletions depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f1">1</xref>A using plasmid shuffling and 5-FOA selection as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f1">1</xref>B, a yeast strain carrying a deletion of the central 24 amino acids of the third zinc finger (ZF3) domain (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Z3</italic>) shows no growth defect when compared to growth of the wild-type strain.

These results suggest that these regions are dispensable for cell growth.</p><p>However, a strain with a deletion of the N-terminal 25 amino acids (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N1</italic>) grows slowly at the permissive temperature of 30&#x000b0;C, and cannot grow at 37&#x000b0;C. Furthermore, a longer deletion of the N-terminal 56 amino acids including ZF1 (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N2</italic>) is lethal. From these results, we conclude that the N-terminal region up to position 56 is essential for Yth1 function. Temperature sensitivity is also observed when a strain carries deletion of the C-terminal 61 amino acids (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>C2</italic>), which includes the fifth zinc finger. This phenotype is similar to the mutant allele yth1-1 that carries a deletion of 50 amino acids at the C-terminus, as shown by Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>). In contrast to <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N1</italic>, the <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>C2</italic> strain grows normally at the permissive temperature and slowly at 37&#x000b0;C. The non-essential nature of the last 33 amino acids suggests that the critical domain removed in yth1&#x00394;C2 may be ZF5. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of an additive effect due to deletion of both regions.</p><p>Deletion of ZF2 from amino acids 67 to 86 (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Z2</italic>) and deletion of the 28 amino acids spanning ZF4 (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Z4</italic>) are lethal, suggesting that ZF2 and ZF4 are essential. Deletion of the central 52 amino acids including ZF3 and ZF4 (<italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>Z3&#x0002f;4</italic>) is also lethal, in agreement with the results that ZF4 is essential. A substitution of the conserved glycine residue for arginine at position 130 in ZF4 gives a temperature-sensitive yeast strain (<italic>yth1G130R</italic>). This result further supports the idea that ZF4 is responsible for an essential function. Finally, none of the viable mutants are cold-sensitive when grown at 16&#x000b0;C.</p><p>We next performed western blot analysis to detect Yth1 in cell extracts and determine whether the growth defects might be the consequence of poor expression of the mutant Yth1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>A, the temperature-sensitive yth1 mutants were successfully immunodetected in these extracts. In the extract from the strain carrying <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N1</italic>, a degradation product was also detected, although the protein level of yth1&#x00394;N1 was similar to that of wild-type Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>A, lane 2). The protein levels of yth1&#x00394;C2 and yth1G130R were only slightly reduced compared to wild-type Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). We also analyzed the levels of eight other processing components (Cft2, Brr5, Pta1, Rna14, Hrp1, Pap1, Fip1 and Rna15) in these extracts, in order to determine whether depletion of other components contributed to the growth deficiency of the mutant strains. In these extracts, all of the protein levels were constant except for that of Fip1, which showed a very small reduction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>To examine the expression of the lethal mutants (yth1&#x00394;N2, &#x00394;Z2, &#x00394;Z3&#x0002f;4 and &#x00394;Z4), we asked whether these proteins could be detected in extracts from strains expressing the lethal mutations in a <italic>YTH1</italic> wild-type background. All truncations were detected in these extracts; but the protein levels varied (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>B). yth1&#x00394;N2 was expressed at higher levels than wild-type. The level of yth1&#x00394;Z2 was reduced compared to wild-type and degraded product was also detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>B, lane 2), but the level of full-length protein was similar to that seen for the viable mutants yth1&#x00394;C2 and yth1G130R. The protein levels of yth1&#x00394;Z3&#x0002f;4 and yth1&#x00394;Z4 were significantly decreased when compared to the level of wild-type Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f2">2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that poor expression may contribute to the lethality of these two deletions. We do not know whether these particular mutations are inherently unstable <italic>in vivo</italic>, or if poor incorporation into CPF, especially in competition with the endogenous wild-type Yth1, results in free mutant yth1 that is recognized as abnormal and targeted for degradation. As shown below, the fact that recombinant yth1&#x00394;Z4 could rescue the critical function of cleavage in a yth1-defective extract is strong support that the protein is folding properly.</p><p>We next examined whether the various Yth1 mutations could function in cleavage and polyadenylation <italic>in vitro</italic> and if they exhibited wild-type interactions with Fip1, Brr5 and RNA, as described in the following sections.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of mutations on processing <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To further define the role of Yth1 in processing, we first prepared extracts from the viable mutant strains grown at permissive temperature and tested them for cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic> using the radioactive substrate <italic>GAL7-1</italic> that contains the <italic>GAL7</italic> poly(A) site and flanking sequences. Poly(A) addition was assayed using the radioactive substrate <italic>GAL7-9</italic> that ended at the <italic>GAL7</italic> poly(A) site. Reactions were performed for 30 min; we have found that very little additional processing occurs after this time period. When the full-length RNA was added to wild-type extract, 27&#x00025; of the full-length RNA input was cleaved, and 97&#x00025; of the cleaved RNA was polyadenylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 2). When the pre-cleaved RNA was added to wild-type extract, 52&#x00025; of the input RNA was polyadenylated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 7). In extract from the strain carrying <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N1</italic>, cleavage activity was not detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 3) and polyadenylation activity was greatly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 8). This result confirms that Yth1 is required in both processing steps, as shown by Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>). Extract prepared from the strain carrying <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>C2</italic> was somewhat reduced for cleavage activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 4) but much more severely affected for polyadenylation in comparison to <italic>YTH1</italic> extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 9). Extract from the strain carrying <italic>yth1G130R</italic> showed a similar level of activity as wild-type in cleavage (33&#x00025;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lane 5), but a weakened polyadenylation activity of 62&#x00025; (compared to 97&#x00025; for wild-type). The defect in polyadenylation is also evident from the accumulation of cleavage product compared to wild-type extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f3">3</xref>, lanes 3 and 5).</p><p>To determine whether <italic>in vitro</italic> processing can be rescued by exogenous Yth1, we carried out complementation assays. We used extract from the <italic>yth1-4</italic> strain, which carries a point mutation in ZF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>), and recombinant Yth1 and mutated proteins expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic> as GST fusions. Reactions were performed in the presence of dATP to block poly(A) addition. None of the recombinant proteins showed any cleavage activity on their own (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f4">4</xref>, lanes 11&#x02013;16). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>), the <italic>yth1-4</italic> extract showed very weak processing activity in both steps, but could be rescued for cleavage with wild-type protein. Addition of recombinant GST-Yth1 stimulated cleavage activity, with 27&#x00025; of the input RNA being processed, compared to 42&#x00025; for wild-type extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f4">4</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). Recombinant GST-yth1&#x00394;Z4 and GST-yth1&#x00394;C2 proteins could also stimulate cleavage, but less efficiently than that of wild-type GST-Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f4">4</xref>, lanes 9 and 10). Recombinant GST-yth1&#x00394;N2 and GST-yth1&#x00394;Z2 proteins could not rescue cleavage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f4">4</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that ZF4 and ZF5 are not required for the cleavage function of Yth1.</p><p>Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) found that GST-Yth1 could not rescue the poly(A) addition defect of yth1-4 extract. We obtained a similar result, with no reconstitution of polyadenylation with GST-Yth1 in extracts from the strains <italic>yth1-4, yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>N1</italic> and <italic>yth1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>C2</italic>, even if the extract was supplemented with Fip1 and Pap1, or pre-treated at 37&#x000b0;C to try to destabilize the heat-labile mutants (data not shown). Moreover, the <italic>GST-YTH1</italic> fusion was able to cover a disruption of the wild-type <italic>YTH1</italic> gene <italic>in vivo</italic>, and removal of the N-terminal tag on recombinant Yth1 did not activate polyadenylation activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. This data supports the previously proposed hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) that recombinant Yth1 is unable to displace the endogenous mutant yth1 from interactions with CPF subunits critical for polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Domains of Yth1 involved in protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions</title><p>By co-immunoprecipitation assays, Yth1 was shown to interact directly with Fip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c51">51</xref>). We carried out similar assays with the recombinant Yth1 deletion series and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged Fip1, in order to determine the Fip1 interaction domain of Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f5">5</xref>). Two mutants, yth1&#x00394;Z3&#x0002f;4 and yth1&#x00394;Z4, did not co-immunoprecipitate with His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f5">5</xref>A, lanes 6 and 7), but all other Yth1 derivatives, including yth1&#x00394;Z3, were immunoprecipitated. Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) reported that the yth1-1 protein with a deletion of the C-terminal 50 amino acids is impaired in the interaction with Fip1. Similarly, we found that the pull-down of yth1&#x00394;C2 by His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 was somewhat less efficient than that of wild-type, but reproducibly detectable, and in striking contrast to the lack of binding of yth1&#x00394;Z4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f5">5</xref>A, lane 8). These results indicate that ZF4 is necessary for Fip1 interaction, and that ZF5 probably stabilizes this interaction but is not required. Furthermore, when <italic>in vitro</italic> translated yth1G130R was used for co-immunoprecipitation instead of proteins expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, yth1G130R showed a weaker interaction with Fip1 compared to Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f5">5</xref>C), consistent with the polyadenylation defect caused by this mutation. This result further supports the idea that ZF4 interacts with Fip1.</p><p>Yth1 also binds to the CPF subunit Brr5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>), but the interaction domain has not been defined. We next performed a GST pull-down assay of GST-fused Yth1 truncations and recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Brr5-HA<sub>3</sub>, to determine the Brr5 interaction domain of Yth1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f6">6</xref>). The wild-type and all of the truncations tested were able to pull down His<sub>6</sub>-Brr5-HA<sub>3</sub>, but GST-yth1&#x00394;N2 and GST-yth1&#x00394;Z4 exhibited a weaker interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f6">6</xref>, lanes 4 and 6). Thus, ZF4 and the N-terminus including ZF1 both contribute to efficient binding of Brr5. It would not be surprising that Brr5, a relatively large protein (100 kDa) in comparison to Yth1 (24 kDa), contacted Yth1 in two places. The fact that Yth1 with the ZF4 deletion lost Fip1 binding and had a weakened Brr5 interaction raised the question of whether the Brr5&#x02013;Yth1 interaction could compete with the Fip1&#x02013;Yth1 interaction at ZF4. However, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay with all three proteins together, we found that His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 and His<sub>6</sub>-Brr5-HA<sub>3</sub> can bind Yth1 at the same time without interference (data not shown).</p><p>By a primer extension assay, we found that Yth1 binds the U-rich stretches of <italic>GAL7</italic> RNA (data not shown), similar to the previous study showing that Yth1 binds RNA with a preference for poly(U) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>). The binding of Yth1 to poly(U) is very weak, and Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) have used UV cross-linking, a more sensitive assay, to monitor the interaction of Yth1 and RNA. We have also found that this assay corresponds well with the ability of protein to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c54">54</xref>). Thus, to determine the RNA interaction domains of Yth1, we performed UV cross-linking with GST-fused Yth1 derivatives and radiolabeled <italic>GAL7-1</italic> RNA. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f7">7</xref>, GST-Yth1 and two truncations, GST-yth1&#x00394;N2 and GST-yth1&#x00394;C2, cross-linked to RNA with comparable efficiencies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f7">7</xref>A, lanes 1, 2 and 5). In contrast, the cross-linking of GST-yth1&#x00394;Z2 and GST-yth1&#x00394;Z4 to RNA was greatly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f7">7</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4). This finding suggests that ZF2 and ZF4 must both be present for normal interaction with RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Fip1 blocks the interaction between Yth1 and RNA</title><p>Because ZF4 is needed for interaction with both Fip1 and RNA, we were curious as to whether the presence of Fip1 would interfere with the RNA interaction. To determine this, we performed a UV cross-linking assay using GST-Yth1 and radiolabeled <italic>GAL7-1</italic> together with His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 as a competitor. We first incubated GST-Yth1 with various amounts of His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 or His<sub>6</sub>-fip1-206, added RNA, and exposed the samples to UV light. The fip1-206 derivative has a deletion of the C-terminal 121 amino acids and does not interact with Yth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c51">51</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f8">8</xref>, the cross-linking efficiency was greatly reduced as the amount of His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 increased. When the GST-Yth1:His<sub>6</sub>-Fip1 molar ratio was 1:1, cross-linking efficiency dropped to 21&#x00025; of that seen without Fip1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f8">8</xref>B). However, addition of His<sub>6</sub>-fip1-206 did not affect cross-linking efficiency. This result suggests that Fip1 occupancy of ZF4 inhibits the interaction of Yth1 with RNA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>While most of the components of the eukaryotic polyadenylation machinery have been identified, little is known about the architecture of the complex or the function of many of the subunits. In this study, we have identified domains in Yth1 important for the protein&#x02019;s activity and its interactions with RNA and the CPF subunits Fip1 and Brr5. The main conclusions from our study are: (i) ZF4 is important for all three interactions and for polyadenylation, but is dispensable for the function of Yth1 in cleavage; (ii) the unique N-terminus of Yth1 (before the five zinc fingers) is essential for both cleavage and poly(A) addition; (iii) only four of the five zinc fingers are necessary; (iv) Fip1 prevents the interaction of Yth1 and RNA. The results of this study are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f9">9</xref>. This new data and the earlier studies with Yth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) support a functional organization of Yth1 in which the C-terminal part is dedicated to polyadenylation, while the N-terminal half is required for both processing steps.</p><p>Our deletion analysis indicates that the N-terminal half can be further subdivided into distinct functional domains. For example, removal of sequence before ZF1 causes a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype and gives extracts impaired for both cleavage and polyadenylation. Further truncation to eliminate ZF1 causes lethality and this mutant Yth1 cannot restore cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, there are no defects in the interaction with Fip1 or RNA, but there is reduced binding to Brr5. It is not clear at this time whether the functional deficit due to loss of the N-terminus is related to the poor interaction with Brr5, or instead with another factor, which like Brr5, is essential for both steps of 3&#x02032; end formation.</p><p>We have found that cells with a deletion of ZF2, also in the N-terminal half of Yth1, are not viable. An analysis by Barabino <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c41">41</xref>) had demonstrated ZF2 to be critical for Yth1 function. In their temperature-sensitive <italic>yth1-4</italic> allele, mutation of a conserved residue in this region (W70A) weakened interaction with the rest of CPF, but not with Fip1 or Brr5, and caused defects in both the cleavage and poly(A) addition steps. Recombinant yth1-4 protein also showed reduced cross-linking to RNA. Consistent with this study, we show that the yth1 protein completely lacking ZF2 could no longer interact well with RNA or rescue cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>, but retained full interaction with Fip1 and Brr5. It is not known which CPF subunit contacts ZF2 of Yth1 and whether RNA binding and CPF interaction contribute equally to ZF2 function.</p><p>The central zinc finger, ZF3, can be eliminated without any consequences to cell survival. This result was surprising given that all of the Yth1 homologs from other species have five zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c29">29</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the next zinc finger, ZF4, located in the C-terminal half, was lethal. However, unlike yth1&#x00394;Z2, yth1&#x00394;Z4 can rescue cleavage <italic>in vitro</italic>. Interestingly, ZF4 is also important for the cross-linking of Yth1 to RNA. These two findings suggest that contact with the RNA precursor through ZF4 must not be important for cleavage. In addition to the RNA binding defect, a ZF4 deletion results in complete loss of Fip1 binding and a weakened Brr5 interaction. Moreover, the fact that the G130R point mutation in ZF4 reduces the efficiency of Fip1 binding and impairs polyadenylation but not cleavage confirms that Fip1 interaction is an important function of ZF4.</p><p>The ZF4 data is consistent with our previous work showing that extracts from cells with a disruption of the Yth1 binding domain on Fip1 (fip1-206) are inactive for polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg265c51">51</xref>). This fip1 mutant has completely lost Yth1 interaction, but is not affected in the ability to bind to Pap1 and to inhibit Pap1 activity. However, unlike the ZF4 deletion, a strain with this <italic>fip1</italic> mutation is viable unless grown at 37&#x000b0;C, suggesting that contacts made between the Fip1&#x0002f;Pap1 heterodimer and components of the polyadenylation complex other than Yth1 are sufficient to incorporate these two proteins into the holoenzyme. This result, together with our new data, suggests that the essential nature of ZF4 in Yth1 is due to at least two functions: the interaction with Fip1 and the interaction with RNA.</p><p>The final zinc finger, ZF5, is an important but non-essential domain of Yth1 that contributes to the efficiency of Fip1 binding. A deletion from the C-terminus which includes ZF5 (yth1&#x00394;C2) causes slower growth at 37&#x000b0;C and extracts deficient for poly(A) addition but not cleavage. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminus beyond the zinc fingers causes no effect on cell growth, even though the interaction with Fip1 may be somewhat diminished. Thus, interactions of Fip1 with ZF4 and ZF5 are sufficient for normal polyadenylation.</p><p>By RNA cross-linking assays, we have found that Yth1 does not bind to RNA and Fip1 at the same time. One interpretation of this result is that ZF4 helps to mediate the switch from cleavage to polyadenylation. A model for this additional function of Yth1 is illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg265f9">9</xref>B. Fip1 binds Pap1 through a domain different from the one responsible for Yth1 interaction. At the cleavage step, Yth1, along with other CPF subunits, binds to RNA at the U-rich regions immediately flanking the poly(A) site, but perhaps not tightly associated with Fip1. Following cleavage, Yth1 continues to bind RNA just upstream of the newly created 3&#x02032; end. At this point, it may be important for Fip1 to displace Yth1 from RNA, so that Pap1 can access the 3&#x02032; end and initiate poly(A) synthesis. Additional research is needed to understand what changes in the configuration of the complex occur following cleavage and how these changes promote polyadenylation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg265f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) A schematic representation of Yth1 mutants used in this study.
