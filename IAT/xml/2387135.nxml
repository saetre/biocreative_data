An RNA interference approach was also employed to selectively knockdown expression of Hif-1&#x003b1;. Apoptosis was analyzed in both H9c2 and HK-2 cells by Hoechst and TUNEL staining, caspase 3 activity assays and activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bax.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overexpression of pcDNA3-DN-Hif-1&#x003b1; led to a significant reduction in hypoxia -induced apoptosis (17 &#x000b1; 2%, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01) in H9c2 cells compared to both control-transfected and wild type Hif-1&#x003b1; transfected cells. Moreover, selective ablation of HIF-1&#x003b1; protein expression by RNA interference in H9c2 cells led to 55% reduction of caspase 3 activity and 46% reduction in the number of apoptotic cells as determined by Hoechst 33258 staining, after hypoxia. Finally, upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, was found in H9c2 cells overexpressing full-length pcDNA3-HA-HIF-1&#x003b1; exposed to hypoxia. In HK-2 cells overexpression of wild-type Hif-1&#x003b1; led to a two-fold increase in Hif-1&#x003b1; levels during hypoxia. This resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in apoptotic cells and a concomitant increase in caspase 3 activity during hypoxia when compared to vector transfected control cells. HIF-1&#x003b1; also induced upregulation of Bax in HK-2 cells. In addition, introduction of dominant negative Hif-1&#x003b1; constructs in both H9c2 and HK-2 -cells led to decreased active Bax expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data demonstrate that HIF-1&#x003b1; is an important component of the apoptotic signaling machinery in the two cell types.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hypoxia-inducible factor -1 is a transcription complex composed of an alpha (Hif-1&#x003b1;) and a beta (Hif-1&#x003b2;) subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. While Hif-1&#x003b2; is constitutively expressed, Hif-1&#x003b1; levels are highly regulated by cellular oxygen tension and determine the cellular responses to variations in the oxygen tension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Whenever Hif-1&#x003b1; is induced in a cell in response to low oxygen conditions it primarily triggers a number of pro-survival events such as increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hence angiogenesis, increased expression of genes for various glycolytic enzymes as well as for the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) thereby enhancing glycolysis, and activation of the erythropoietin gene and hence erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Over the past decade it has become clear that hypoxia induces programmed cell death, or apoptosis, through a mitochondrial dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] involving release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase 9 and subsequent cleavage and activation of downstream, effector caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Multiple factors are involved in this programmed cell death pathway but because it largely determines the cellular response to hypoxia, Hif-1 has been a candidate to also regulate hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Despite its clear role in cellular protection, there have been a number of reports demonstrating that Hif-1 also contributes to programmed cell death during hypoxia [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. Recent reports have centered on the effects of Hif-1 on transactivation of the BNIP3 gene in certain cells such as cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The BNIP3 gene product induces apoptosis by binding and inhibiting the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, BNIP3 is not present in all cells, and Hif-1 clearly does not induce apoptosis in many cell types. For example, Hif-1 prevents hypoxia-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, the role of Hif-1 in apoptosis remains somewhat controversial and appears to be cell type and context specific.</p><p>Previously, we have found that enhanced glycolytic metabolism and GLUT1 expression markedly attenuate hypoxia induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and that enhanced glycolytic metabolism and GLUT1 expression suppress levels of Hif-1&#x003b1; in hypoxic cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently hyperglycemia has been demonstrated to inhibit HIF-1&#x003b1; expression, inhibit hypoxia-induced decreased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and a concomitant decrease in hypoxia response element (HRE) promoter transactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that reduction of Hif-1&#x003b1; induced by GLUT1 and glucose metabolism was mechanistically important in the prevention of apoptosis and that Hif-1 plays a proapoptotic role in our systems, especially in the absence of glucose transport. To test this latter hypothesis we determined the effect of Hif-1&#x003b1; expression in both a cardiac myocyte cell line and a kidney epithelial cell line. The rationale for using two different cell lines was to underscore the importance of Hif-1 in two distinct cell types which are clinically relevant for apoptosis in cardiac (H9c2) and renal (HK-2) ischemia. We found that Hif-1 enhances apoptosis and that hypoxia-induced apoptosis can be markedly suppressed by either a dominant negative Hif-1&#x003b1; construct or shRNA induced knockdown of Hif-1&#x003b1;. Hif-1&#x003b1; expression is also associated with enhanced Bax activation in these systems thereby providing a mechanistic link between hypoxic stress and apoptosis in these two cell types.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The embryonic rat heart derived H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), antibiotics (50 U/ml penicillin and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Transfection efficiencies were monitored by counting EGFP positive cells. In H9c2 and HK-2 cells the average transfection efficiency of six independent experiments (n = 6) was 22 &#x000b1; 5% and 48 &#x000b1; 7.6% respectively. Two days after transfection, H9c2 cells were subjected to 6&#x02013;24 h of hypoxia in regular DMEM, deficient in glucose, but supplemented with 10% FCS. For HK-2 cells, hypoxia of 16 h was performed in complete keratinocyte basal serum-free medium as outlined above.</p><p>Whole cell lysates were prepared according to standard protocol.

After completion of cloning the U6 entry vector with the inserted RNAi cassette was transiently transfected into cells using Fugene (Roche Biochemicals). shRNA oligos which generated optimal silencing of Hif-1&#x003b1; had the following complementary strand sequences : 5'-AGAGGUGGAUAUGUGUGGGdTdT-3' and 5'-CCAACACAUAUCCACCUCUdTdT-3'.</p></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis analysis</title><p>Assessment of cellular apoptotic morphologies after transfection and hypoxia was accomplished by plating the H9c2 and HK-2 cells in 2 well Falcon glass culture slides (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). pEGFP was co-transfected with the other constructs to aid in the identification of transfected cells for counting purposes. The cells were rinsed in PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, and rinsed again in PBS. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. The cells were rinsed in PBS and then stained directly with anti-HA-fluorescein or anti-Flag-fluorescein monoclonal antibodies (Roche Biochemicals). After rinsing in PBS the cells were also stained with the karyophillic dye Hoechst 33258 (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. After a final rinse in PBS the cells were mounted in moiwol (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), an antifade agent, and visualized under fluorescent light (for detection of EGFP, HA and Flag epitopes respectively) and switched to ultraviolet light (for visualization of Hoechst 33258) with a Leitz Orthoplan microscope.

The 6A7 antibody detects an epitope at the N terminus of Bax that is occluded in the inactive state and is exposed upon Bax activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. H9c2 cells, transfected with pEGFP, DN and wild-type Hif-1&#x003b1; vectors, were selected as described in Materials and Methods. Whole cell lysates of H9c2 cells expressing EGFP and wild type Hif-1&#x003b1; demonstrated a strong activation of Bax, while lysates of cells expressing EGFP alone displayed little Bax activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Interestingly, H9c2 cells transfected with DN Hif-1&#x003b1; displayed reduced Bax expression thereby suggesting that Hif-1&#x003b1; was responsible for Bax activation. Although we did not observe any significant increase in apoptosis under similar transfection conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) these results suggest that Hif-1&#x003b1; may promote Bax activation during hypoxia.

Using a combination of three approaches to document apoptosis in these cells, we found that transfection with wild type Hif-1&#x003b1; followed by hypoxia of 16 h resulted in substantial apoptosis whereas, under these conditions at least, there was no significant increase in apoptosis in hypoxic vector-control transfected cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5 B&#x02013;D</xref>). These findings are somewhat different than those in H9c2 cardiac cells which demonstrated substantial hypoxia-induced apoptosis that was not augmented by Hif-1&#x003b1; overexpression, but which was ameliorated when Hif-1&#x003b1; was reduced or inhibited.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of HIF-1&#x003b1; overexpression on apoptosis in HK-2 subjected to 16 h of hypoxia.

Conversely, Hif-1 can also stimulate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and cell death during hypoxia, [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]]. However, the role of Hif-1 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis remains controversial, and several reports have found that Hif-1 actually protects some cell types from apoptosis, presumably in a cell-type and context specific manner [e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]]. We previously found that glucose uptake and metabolism or enhanced expression of the facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT1, protected cardiac myocytes and other cell types from hypoxia-induced apoptosis via reduced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, we found that enhanced glucose uptake and metabolism or increased GLUT1 expression resulted in reduced Hif-1&#x003b1; levels due to enhanced Hif-1 &#x003b1; proteosomal degradation despite persistent hypoxia in these same cardiac myocytes and heart-derived H9c2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A similar effect of hyperglycemia on reduction of Hif-1&#x003b1; levels and apoptosis has been demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In a rat model of cerebral ischemia both mRNA and protein expression of Hif-1&#x003b1; and procaspase 3 was also shown to be increased after 12- and 24-hours of ischemic insult and increase in specific Hif-1 binding to the caspase 3 gene promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that Hif-1 promoted mitochondrial cell death pathway in H9c2 cells and that glucose-induced reduction in Hif-1&#x003b1; levels contributed to the anti-apoptotic effects of glucose uptake and metabolism.</p><p>The present report demonstrates that Hif-1&#x003b1; potentiates apoptosis under hypoxic conditions in both rat H9c2 cells and human renal epithelial HK-2 cells. Overexpression of a dominant negative Hif-1&#x003b1; that lacked DNA binding domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain as well as shRNA targeted to Hif-1&#x003b1; decreased hypoxia-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Conversely, overexpression of wild type Hif-1&#x003b1; increased apoptosis in HK-2 cells, whereas it had little effect in H9c2 cells, suggesting that levels of Hif-1&#x003b1; in these cells during hypoxia were already sufficient to maximally trigger apoptosis. These differences may reflect the relative levels of Hif-1&#x003b1; in the two cell lines and also the threshold of Hif-1&#x003b1; overexpression needed to trigger a significant apoptotic response. Thus, in HK-2 cells with the existing endogenous levels of Hif-1&#x003b1;, hypoxia could have resulted in relatively small increases in caspase activity and apoptosis, but augmenting Hif-1 &#x003b1; levels boosted those apoptotic features. On the other hand, in H9c2 cells overexpression of Hif-1&#x003b1; had little effects on apoptosis, but reduction of Hif-1&#x003b1; inhibited apoptosis.</p><p>These observations are consistent with other studies showing that Hif-1 promotes apoptosis in cardiac myocytes and other cells by induction of the cell death factors BNIP3 and NIX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or by stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As noted above, however, several studies have reported that Hif-1&#x003b1; is a prosurvival factor and can protect cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Most of these latter studies have been performed in tumor or tumor derived cells in which adaptation to the hypoxic microenvironment leads to the selection of certain malignant tumor phenotypes, which may select Hif-1 as a survival factor.</p><p>In cardiac myocytes and kidney epithelial cells which under normal circumstances are not normally exposed to a hypoxic microenvironment, Hif-1 may serve dual roles as a survival and death factor depending upon the severity and duration of insult or injury. For example, a recent study in which primary cardiac myocyte cultures were exposed to metabolic inhibition with cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose documented survival benefits of inhibiting the family of the O<sub>2</sub>-dependent prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes responsible for targeting Hif-1&#x003b1; for proteosomal degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These inhibitors stabilize Hif-1&#x003b1; levels. This report suggested that under certain circumstances, Hif-1 can be anti-apoptotic in cardiac myocytes. However, there may have been some nonspecific effects in this study since the two inhibitors used in this report were used at concentrations somewhat higher than in most other reports (500 &#x003bc;M) and would have affected levels of other proteins. Nonetheless, other recent studies have corroborated the protective effects of HIF-1-dependent pathways in cardiac myocytes by overexpressing constitutively stable hybrid forms of HIF-1&#x003b1; or with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against HIF-1&#x003b1;-prolyl-4&#x02013;hydroxylase-2 gene, thus stabilizing HIF-1&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Why our results differ from these previous reports is unclear, and could be due to the use of somewhat different cell systems and conditions. One important difference is that our systems combined both true hypoxia with glucose withdrawal. Since we and others have clearly shown that glucose uptake and metabolism helps protect cells from various extracellular stresses including hypoxia and growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], the absence of this protective response will allow greater Hif-1&#x003b1; activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and possibly potentiate its pro-apoptotic activity.</p><p>Hypoxia has also been shown to activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), an essentially adaptive response that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to stresses that reduce or alter protein folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Though recent reports demonstrate that hypoxia activates the UPR in cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] which may potentially protect the myocardium during hypoxic stress, the fact that in the event of an unresolved ER stress the UPR can also activate the apoptotic cell death program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] also needs to be addressed.</p><p>Finally, our studies suggest, but do not prove, that Hif-1&#x003b1; promotes apoptosis by activating the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax. Previous reports have suggested that Hif-1 is necessary for hypoxia-induced Bax expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, other reports have not substantiated this relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Consistent with our observations, a recent report also demonstrates hypoxia-mediated apoptosis in temperature sensitive rat proximal tubular cells through a mechanism independent of Bax upregulation at least at the permissive temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Whether Hif-1 directly activates Bax gene expression or induces Bax expression through some intermediate factor or factors is not clear and needs further investigation. In both H9c2 and HK-2 cells Hif-1 expression leads to upregulation of active Bax and introduction of dominant negative constructs of Hif-1&#x003b1; leads to reduced Bax expression. Whether Bax directly contributed to increased apoptosis in HK-2 and H9c2 cells still needs to be addressed. One obvious candidate which could be involved in Bax induction is the tumor suppressor protein p53. Numerous studies have documented that Hif-1 stabilizes p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and that p53 can induce Bax translocation and thus engage the mitochondrial cell death pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Simultaneously hypoxia leads to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and previous reports have convincingly demonstrated that these mitochondrial ROS are both sufficient and necessary to activate HIF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Activation of HIF-1a by a redox-senstive pathway has also been shown to promote mitochondrial cell death pathway by upregulating BNIP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] thereby providing a complex regulatory network where HIF-1&#x003b1; induction either upstream or downstream of the mitochondria finally leads to increased expression of mitochondrial death factors (Bax, BNIP3 etc) and resultant apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hif-1 plays a master regulatory role in the cellular response to hypoxia.
