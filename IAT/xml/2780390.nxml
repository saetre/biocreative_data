Aurora-A inhibitory VX-680 suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis and markedly reduced migration in cancer cells. We further showed that insulin-like growth factor-1, a PI3K physiological activator, reversed VX-680-decreased cell survival and motility. Conversely, wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, combined with VX-680 showed a synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis and suppressing migration. In addition, Aurora-A inhibition suppressed Akt activation, and VX-680-induced apoptosis was attenuated by Myr-Akt overexpression, revealing a cross-talk between Aurora-A and PI3K pathway interacting at Akt activation. Significantly, we showed that suppression of Aurora-A decreased phosphorylated Akt and was associated with increased IkappaB&#x003b1; expression. By contrast, Aurora-A overexpression upregulated Akt activity and downregulated IkappaB&#x003b1;, these changes were accompanied by nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B and increased expression of its target gene Bcl-xL. Lastly, Aurora-A overexpression induced IkappaB&#x003b1; reduction was abrogated by suppression of Akt either chemically or genetically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our data established that Aurora-A, via activating Akt, stimulated nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway to promote cancer cell survival, and promised a novel combined chemotherapy targeting both Aurora-A and PI3K in cancer treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Mammalian Aurora kinases, including Aurora A, B, and C, represent a new family of serine/threonine kinases crucial for several physiological processes including cytokinesis and chromosome segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Aberrant expression and activity of Aurora kinase lead to formation of abnormal spindle in mitosis and aneuploidy which are closely associated with genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Indeed, Aurora-A (Aur-A) is frequently overexpressed in various cancer types, such as ovarian, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Overexpression of Aur-A induces tumorigenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance, correlating with its pro-survival function in cancer cells. Thus, Aurora kinase has been considered to be an oncoprotein and a promising molecular target for cancer therapy.</p><p>We and others previously reported that Aur-A-induced cell survival and migration were correlated with Akt activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in survival and invasion in human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Akt, which consists of a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases, plays a key role in mediating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-stimulated cell survival response. Many pro-apoptotic proteins have been identified as direct or indirect Akt substrates, including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), Bad and forkhead transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition, Aur-A was reported to up-regulate NF-&#x003ba;B signaling by phosphorylation of IkappaB&#x003b1;(I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. NF-&#x003ba;B stimulates proliferation and blocks apoptosis via modulating transcription of pro-survival genes such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 in a number of cancer cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Intra-cellular negative regulation of NF-&#x003ba;B is controlled primarily through interactions with I&#x003ba;B family, which prevent nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-&#x003ba;B. The exact mechanism and pathway by which Aur-A promotes cancer cell survival and anti-apoptosis however remain unclear.</p><p>Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), the common type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with a high mortality rate. The poor survival of tongue cancer is mainly due to tumor recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis, the most reliable prognostic indicators for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Enhanced cytotoxicity has been observed when anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab (Erbitux, C225) is used in combination with a number of conventional cytotoxic therapies, including cisplatin and paclitaxel to avoid the severe side-effect. Thus designing new drugs or combined chemotherapy aiming to enhance cytotoxicity and attenuate side-effect becomes urgent and challenging tasks.</p><p>In this study, we first showed that Aur-A was overexpressed in TSCC tissues and closely correlated with lymph node metastasis in patients. Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] demonstrated a potent anti-tumor activity against various aspects of TSCC tumor progression, offering an opportunity for target therapy. More interestingly, we showed that activation of PI3K signaling by IGF-1 abrogated Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 induced apoptosis, whereas combination of VX-680 and PI3K inhibitor induced synergistic effects on inducing apoptosis and reducing migration in cancer cells. These data suggested a cross-talk between Aur-A and PI3K signaling pathway in regulating cell survival and migration. More importantly, we found that Aur-A downregulated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; via Akt activation, and subsequently induced NF-&#x003ba;B p65 translocated to nuclei where expression of its target gene Bcl-xL was increased, pointing that Aur-A promoted cell survival via Akt-mediated I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. Taken together, understanding the mechanism underlying the pro-survival activity of Aur-A and the link between Aur-A and PI3K pathway provide a new insight and rationale for future combined molecular targeting therapeutics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Aur-A is overexpressed in TSCC tissues and correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis</title><p>We used the immunohistochemical analysis to investigate Aur-A expression in primary tumor tissues.

However, Aur-A was significantly elevated in majority (36/55, 65.5%) of pathologically confirmed tumor specimens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>).

Decreased pAkt and elevated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; were detected when cells were transfected with siRNA toward either Akt (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>) or Aur-A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>), compared with cells transfected with their scramble control respectively. Inhibition of Aur-A chemically also up-regulated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of Aur-A increased Akt activity and decreased I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; level compared with the vector control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). We then analyzed the expression of Bcl-xL, which is known as a NF-&#x003ba;B target gene closely associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. Bcl-xL was down-regulated in Aur-A and Akt depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 showed that Aur-A overexpression was significantly associated with p65 nuclear translocation whereas p65 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm in cells transfected with empty vector pCS2+ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). We further showed that inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin did not prevent either an increase of pAkt and Bcl-xL or a decrease in I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; caused by Aur-A overexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d</xref>). Interestingly, in cells incubated with Akt inhibitor API-2 or siRNA against Akt, overexpression of Aur-A however failed to reduce I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; or raise Bcl-xL expression in comparison to the vector control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6f</xref>). This suggested that Akt, but not PI3K, was involved in the down-regulation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; by Aur-A. These results revealed that Aur-A, via its downstream target Akt, down-regulated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1;, which then led to NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation and subsequently activating NF-&#x003ba;B target gene Bcl-xL in enhancing cancer cell survival (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6g</xref>).</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Aur-A down-regulates I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; via Akt phosphorylation and induces p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation</bold>.

However, the exact pathway by which Aur-A enhances cell survival has not been well defined. In this study, we showed that Aur-A, via activating Akt pathway, induced NF-&#x003ba;B nuclear translocation to promote cell survival. Indeed, overexpression of Aur-A was positively associated with clinic stage and lymph node metastasis in TSCC patients. Moreover, we established a cross-talk between mitotic Aurora kinase and IGF-1-induced PI3K survival pathway, interacting at Akt activation. Combined inhibition of both Aur-A and PI3K led to a synergistic effect on inducing apoptosis and suppressing migration, reassuring an emerging theme of combination therapy in cancer treatment.</p><p>Aur-A, a key regulator of mitosis, is essential for centrosome function, spindle assembly, and mitotic entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Dysregulation of Aur-A has been linked to tumorigenesis. Previous studies have also shown that Aur-A functions as a pro-survival protein that counteract apoptosis and induce drug resistance in tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We and others demonstrated that Aur-A promoted cell survival and migration by Akt activation, and Aur-A activated NF-&#x003ba;B via I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, a clear pathway from Aur-A activation to cell survival remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that inhibition of Aur-A induced cell apoptosis accompanied with suppressing Akt activation, increasing I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; level and down-regulating Bcl-xL expression. On the contrary, overexpression of Aur-A led to Akt activation and I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; down-regulation, subsequently induced NF-&#x003ba;B p65 nuclear translocation to enhance cell survival. Moreover, suppression of Akt by either API-2 or siAkt prevented Aur-A-induced I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; reduction and Bcl-xL elevation. Thus, our data demonstrated that Aur-A downregulated I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; via Akt activation, triggering NF-&#x003ba;B p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently activating target gene Bcl-xL to promote survival in cancer cells.</p><p>Inactivation of PTEN leads to constitutively activate PI3K/Akt pathway. Recently, Aur-A was found to abrogate the DNA-binding and transactivation activity of p53 and subsequently inhibit its downstream target genes including <italic>PTEN </italic>by phosphorylating Ser 215 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. PTEN expression was significantly reduced in Aur-A overexpressed cells with activated Akt activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here, we showed that overexpression of Aur-A increased the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Consistently, previous report showed that Aur-A activated Akt in a p53-dependent manner to induce cell survival and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, it is conceivable that Aur-A activates Akt via inhibiting PTEN.</p><p>Akt promotes cell survival by its ability to phosphorylate and inactivate several pro-apoptotic targets including GSK-3. We showed that inhibition of Aur-A resulted in suppressed phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK-3, according with one recent study that Aur-A promoted cell proliferation by increasing the phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, another work reported that Akt inhibitor A-443654 interfered with mitotic progression by decreasing Aur-A expression, suggesting Akt acts upstream of Aur-A by regulating its transcription level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We and others showed that Aur-A contributed to cell survival, chemoresistance and migration via activation of Akt, suggesting a positive feedback interplaying between Aur-A and Akt.</p><p>Akt plays a part in activation of NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway and exerts a positive effect on NF-&#x003ba;B function by phosphorylation and activation of IKK, a kinase that phosphorylates and induces proteolytic degradation of the NF-&#x003ba;B inhibitor, I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Interestingly, several recent reports have suggested that Aur-A kinase may serve both upstream and downstream of the IKK complex components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. IKK complex includes two catalytic components, IKK&#x003b1; and IKK&#x003b2;. As a downstream target, Aur-A was phosphorylated by IKK&#x003b1; at threonine residue 288, a site which is important for its kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Depletion of IKK&#x003b2; resulted in the up-regulation of Aur-A protein, and IKK&#x003b2; functioned as an antagonist of Aur-A signaling during mitosis in normal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. On the other hand, we showed that Aur-A promoted cell survival through activated IKK/NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway, consistent with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thus, there may be a reciprocal regulation between Aur-A and IKK complex.</p><p>Activation of Akt was associated with adverse outcome in tongue cancer patients, serving as a significant prognostic factor in TSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Multiple growth factors such as IGF-1, VEGF, and EGF facilitate the development and progression of cancer by activating PI3K pathway leading to cell survival and therapeutic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Here, we showed that Aur-A was overexpressed in tongue cancer tissue and tightly correlated with clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in patients (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of mitotic Aur-A kinase and abnormal activation PI3K survival pathway are two essential but distinct biological processes in cancer progression. As tumorigenesis is a multiple process, combination therapeutic strategies have shown substantially enhanced anti-tumor effects and reduced side-effects both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>. A recent study reported that combined treatment with the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat and Aur-A kinase inhibitor MK-0457 (VX-680) showed a synergistic anti-leukemia activity in cultured and primary AML and CML cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that Aur-A inhibitory VX-680 could markedly reduce IGF-1 induced survival and migration. Furthermore, combinational inhibition of Aur-A and PI3K showed a synergic effect in causing apoptosis and suppressing migration in cancer cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our findings demonstrated that Aur-A stimulated NF-&#x003ba;B signaling pathway via Akt activation to promote cancer cell survival, and formed a conceptual basis for the combination chemotherapy of targeting both Aurora kinase and growth factor-induced PI3K pathway for inhibiting the enhanced survival and migration of cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and clinical tissue specimens</title><p>Fifty-five patients who performed radical surgery were original clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed of TSCC between 1987 and 1992.
