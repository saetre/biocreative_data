The existence of sporadic forms of prion diseases such as scrapie implies an environmental source for the infectious agent. This would suggest that under certain conditions the prion protein, the accepted agent of transmission, can survive in the environment. We have developed a novel technique to extract the prion protein from soil matrices. Previous studies have suggested that environmental manganese is a possible risk factor for prion diseases. We have shown that exposure to manganese is a soil matrix causes a dramatic increase in prion protein survival (&#x0223c;10 fold) over a two year period. We have also shown that manganese increases infectivity of mouse passaged scrapie to culture cells by 2 logs. These results clearly verify that manganese is a risk factor for both the survival of the infectious agent in the environment and its transmissibility.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) remains a major problem in several countries despite concerted efforts to eradicate the disease. As the pattern of incidence rules out spontaneous outbreak of disease, evidence suggests the environment is the source of the infective agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Leita1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Hadlow1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Miller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This agent may enter the soil via infected carcasses, meat products or farm effluent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Gale1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown that some residual infectivity remains after three years in soil that had been exposed to infected material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brown1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Natural processes in the soil such a bacterial activity, exposure to UV radiation and soil acidity should be deleterious for even the most resilient organic material.</p><p>The infective agent in prion diseases is now accepted to be an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Prusiner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in order for the infective agent to survive in the environment, significant amounts of PrP must be able to resist normal mechanisms of protein degradation and it is currently not known how this would be possible. PrP is a metal binding protein with high affinity for copper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brown2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Davies1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> but also has affinity for manganese similar to other manganese binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brazier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Interactions with metals may be able to contribute to the proteins stability and resistance against degradation in soil. For example, it has been shown that manganese can cause PrP to fold into a proteinase resistant form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brown3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Certainly, many metals exist within soils and it may therefore be possible that these interactions contribute to PrP's longevity in the environment. There is also some evidence of high manganese and low copper levels in areas of high scrapie incidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Ragnarsdottir1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A clear understanding of how PrP interacts with soils is important in order to assess whether metals contribute to the stability of PrP in the environment.</p><p>The mechanism of protein adsorption on to soil particles is far from straight forward. Complicating factors include soil pH and constituents and protein PI, conformation, size, charge, solubility and flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Norde1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Stumm1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of soil/protein interactions have, therefore, been studied with model systems, especially with constituent clays such as kaolinite (kte) and montmorillonite (mte). One study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-ServagentNoinville1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> showed the importance of electronegative interactions in the adsorbance of bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto mte and how the strength of these interactions could alter the conformation and properties of the protein. Other studies have shown specifically the very strong adsorptive nature of soil clays to proteins, especially prions. Leita et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Leita1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated the difficulty in desorbing prions from clay, especially mte and suggested that the conditions in most soils would favour an accumulation of stable prions in soils exposed to contaminated material. Another such study suggested that mte would promote an orientation of PrP towards the soil involving elements across the entire protein in both the N and C terminus, making the adsorption almost irreversible in its strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Revault1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Another study confirmed that PrP could adsorb strongly to clay and remain infectious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. With the protein/soil interactions well characterised, it is possible to construct model systems whereby the stability of both Metal bound and apo forms of PrP<sup>c</sup> and PrP<sup>sc</sup> can be studied.</p><p>The connection between prion disease and metals is well established. In particular, there is evidence that patients and animals with TSEs have altered level of manganese often in specific regions associated with the loss of neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Wong1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Bost1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Thackray1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Hesketh1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Hesketh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Cells infected with prions show elevated levels of manganese and also show increased expression of the protein DMT-1 associated with uptake of manganese into cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Kralovicova1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Altering the diet to increase manganese results in an increased expression of PrP in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Kralovicova1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and increased expression of PrP is known to increase the chance of prion infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Fischer1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. There is already some evidence that altered copper levels modulate prion infection in animal models of TSE but it is still unclear as to whether manganese changes in the brain are secondary to prion infection or whether the increase manganese increases susceptibility to infection.</p><p>The aims of the study were to assess the stability of recombinant PrP on a model soil over a period of 24 months in the presence or absence of copper and manganese metals. The stability of PrP<sup>c</sup> and PrP<sup>sc</sup> in the presence of soils and metals was also studied. We also examine the ability of manganese to modulate infection of cultured cells with scrapie. Our results demonstrate that manganese dramatically increases PrP survival in soils and lowers the effective dose needed to infect cells with scrapie.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Adsorption properties of model soils</title><p>Initially, an evaluation of the total capacity of mte and kte for PrP was carried out. Various amounts of mte from 0 mg to 12 mg were added to 15 ml falcon tubes along with 5 ml of recombinant mPrP to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The solutions were stirred for two hours before being centrifuged at 800&#x000d7;g for 10minutes. The supernatant was collected and submitted to BCA analysis.

The base idea behind the method is to use the proteins existing electrostatic charge by developing a polar potential difference across the clay, while trapping the substrate and allowing the protein to deadsorb and become trapped on a membrane. PrP is a basic protein with a PI of 9.6. Using this theory, a desorption apparatus was constructed. Protein/clay mixtures in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 5 were set in cooling polyacrylamide gel inside plastic tubes of 5 mm diameter.

However, normal soils are an unacceptable medium for rigorous scientific analysis because of the multiple variables present in their constituents. The clay montmorillonite is used to provide a controlled substrate for the analysis because of its highly defined character. Initial attempts to remove the protein from the clay provided evidence of just how strong the PrP-mte association is. Despite all the methods tested, it was impossible to remove much protein unless severe denaturing and heat treatments were used. These methods, although effective, meant that any useful information stored within the protein would be lost on desorption. Additionally, significant degradation to the protein was observed which proved to be N-terminal loss, an element not only required for infection but also for stable adsorption to the clay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Cooke1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This fits in well with other tandem studies that have shown PrP is difficult to remove <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Leita1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Wiggins1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Pucci1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> or even impossible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Revault1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. A previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> also demonstrated N-terminal loss on extraction from a clay matrix. None of these methods are therefore suitable for removing protein from the clay matrix.</p><p>A previous attempt has been made to extract rPrP from mte using electrophoretic methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Rigou1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. This study relied on harsh denaturing conditions involving SDS and DTT but we wanted to devise an extraction process which would avoid such conditions. Additionally, the study relied on the charge conferred to the protein by SDS binding. All proteins carry a specific charge at pH above or below their point of ionisation (PI). For PrP, a basic PI of 9.6 confers a strong positive charge at neutral or acidic pH. By using this property of protein, PrP was removed successfully from the clay using electrophoretic desorption without any need to denature secondary structure. This allowed for an assessment of how well the entire protein survived on the clay over time. Even in the absence of metals, rPrP resisted degradation remarkable well and after 24 months some trace amounts were still detectible. This supports other studies which have shown increased PrP stability when associated with clays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Johnson1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Johnson2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, these studies have demonstrated that PrP may even be more infectious via oral ingestion when associated with clay. However, a period of around 2 years does appear to reduce the amount of PrP surviving significantly. There was a clear difference between protein adsorbed to clay with metals present and absent. PrP adsorbed to a Cu-mte matrix resisted degradation significantly better than that adsorbed to clay alone, although after 2 years exposure, the majority of the protein had degraded to a 16 kDa fragment. The most striking effect was when protein was adsorbed to a Mn-mte matrix. Even after 24 months, there was little evidence of any significant degradation and the full length protein was still apparent on Western blots. This effect was mirrored by the studies using cellular and disease PrP, an important fact that demonstrated that neither the PK resistance nor glycosylation of the protein play a significant role in the proteins stability in soil. The implication is that the presence of manganese in the soil is the main governing factor as to whether the protein is degraded or not. This observation is closely supported by studies showing that manganese can cause PrP to fold into a protease resistant form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brown3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and further studies highlighting increased manganese levels in brains of affected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Hesketh2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. It also provides a potential link to whether studies showing elevated manganese in soil are relevant to disease outbreak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Ragnarsdottir1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Purdey1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Nishida1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Chihota1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Purdey2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. It should be noted, however, that many other factors present in soil would accelerate protein degradation, such as microbial activity. However, given the 10 fold difference in PrP survival in the presence of manganese, if PrP was to survive it is mostly likely to be in a manganese rich soil matrix.</p><p>Our laboratory has previously demonstrated some interesting consequences when manganese is bound to PrP, not least the dramatic affects on the protein's redox chemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brazier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Our work showed that the protein was capable of taking part in and being altered by manganese catalysed redox chemistry that could significantly alter the properties of PrP. This ties in well with other work that demonstrated an affect by manganese oxides on PrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Russo1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, although this study did suggest a deleterious affect, although not in the presence of soil, and with a form of manganese that would be extremely toxic to animals.</p><p>The mechanism of PrP stabilisation in the presence of manganese does not appear to involve known metal binding elements within the protein. Studies with Mn-mte using a mutant PrP with all N-terminal histidines removed did not reduce the proteins resistance to degradation when compared to wildtype protein. This suggests that the interaction between Mn and PrP that allows increased survival is via the low affinity site associated with the octa-repeat region in the N-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Brazier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> or elsewhere in the protein.</p><p>While the ability of the protein to survive in soil is an important aspect of transmission from the environment, infection requires interaction of the protein with cells. Although manganese has been suggested as a risk factor for increased infection, there is currently no evidence that it alters susceptibility to infection. Our data provides evidence for a 100 fold increase in cellular sensitivity to infection in the presence of elevated (non-toxic) manganese levels. These data provide another link in that while manganese may enable prion survival in soil, it would also endow a selective advantage to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> with manganese bound to cause infection in an animal when ingested. In other words a Mn associated prion is a 100 times more likely to cause infection than a &#x0201c;metal-free&#x0201d; prion. While numerous reports about TSE associations with manganese rich areas have suggested that increased ingestion of Mn leads to increased TSE incidence are possibly misguided in that dietary absorption of manganese is highly limited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Pennington1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, the possibility that the environment might allow prions to survive and be more infectious is a possibly more reasonable hypothesis.</p><p>In conclusion, soil metals do have a significant affect on PrP stabilisation on clays. This is in addition to an already striking ability for the protein to stably adsorb to minerals in soils and survive the harsh conditions in the soil environment. It is therefore possible that where areas of high manganese are present, PrP in both its cellular and disease forms could survive for longer periods and hence potentially be transmitted to new hosts. The association of PrP with manganese potentially makes prions more infectious as cell culture studies show increased susceptibility to infection in the presence of elevated manganese. These results suggest that methods to separate prions from manganese might render them less infectious.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><p>Unless stated all materials were purchased from Sigma.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Model Clays</title><p>The two most commonly used model soil systems used for protein-soil interaction studies are montmorillonite (mte) and kaolinite (kte).

All proteins were generated tag-free. 0.5 mM EDTA was added to the protein to chelate any metals present. All subsequent steps used double deionised water treated with Chelex resin, to remove residual metal ions. The denatured protein was refolded by a ten fold dilution of the urea in deionised water, concentration by ultra-filtration and two rounds of dialysis to remove residual urea, imidazole and EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured using theoretical extinction coefficients at 280 nm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html">http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html</ext-link>) and confirmed by BCA assay (Sigma). Protein purity was checked using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Bradford Assay</title><p>Triplicate protein standards of 0 to 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.1 mg/ml intervals were prepared using MilliQ water to 10 &#x000b5;l. For each protein of interest, 10 &#x000b5;l samples were also prepared. Bradford reagent was then diluted 5 fold n MilliQ water. 1 ml of this solution was then added to each of the standards and samples, vortexed and incubated at 25&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. The solutions were then transferred to plastic cuvettes and spectrographically analysed at 595 nm in a Cary UV Vis spectrophotometer. From the standards, a calibration curve was calculated and used to determine the protein concentration of the samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Protein samples of either recombinant protein or from cultured cells were electrophoresed on 12&#x00025; polyacrylamide gels. Protein immobilised within the gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane by a semi-dry transfer method. Blotting paper was soaked in transfer buffer (500 ml 1 x running buffer, 200 ml methanol and 300 ml ddH<sub>2</sub>O). PVDA membrane (pre-soaked in methanol) was placed on top of the blotting paper with the 2D gel placed on top of this. A final piece of blotting paper was placed on top. The transfer was run for 90 minutes at 50 mA, 25 V using a Bio-Rad semi-dry blotter. The membrane was then blocked in tris buffered saline containing 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) Tween and 5&#x00025; (w/v) (TBS-T) milk powder for 1 hour, shaking. Membranes were probed with either ICMS-18 or 8B4 monoclonal mPrP primary antibody. After rinsing the membrane in TBS-T 3 times, the antibody was diluted 15000 times in TBS-T containing 5&#x00025; milk powder overnight at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The membrane was then washed again in TBS-T 5 times before being incubated to secondary HRP antibody, again diluted 15000 times in TBS-T containing 5&#x00025; milk powder for 45 minutes at room temperature. Following extensive washing in TBS-T, the membrane was developed for 2 minutes with ECL reagent and exposed to film for between 15 seconds and 30 minutes. A Compact X-ray processor was used to develop the film. The relative amount of protein present on the blot was quantified using the densitometer function in Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>The cells used to prepare PrP rich extracts were SMB (scrapie mouse brain) which express PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and the pentosan sulphate cured control line (SMB-PS) which only expresses PrP<sup>c</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007518-Birkett1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> were maintained at 37&#x000b0;C and 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Lonza) supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS (Lonza) in 75 ml culture flasks. Following achievement of 95&#x00025; confluency, cells were split 1 in 4 to ensure continued health. This was carried out by aspirating off the used media and releasing the cells by digestion with 2 ml trypsin (Lonza) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Trypsin was then inactivated by the addition of 10 ml fresh media and the cells divided into 4 fresh flasks.</p><p>For infection experiments SMB-PS cells were plated at 50&#x00025; confluency in 6 well trays. An extract in PBS was prepared from SMB cells by scraping the cells from the flask. The extracts were sonicated and the debris pelleted by centrifugation at 14 k r.p.m. The protein content of the supernatant was quantified and diluted to 200 mg/ml before digestion with 50 &#x000b5;g/ml proteinase K (PK) for 1 hour at room temperature. The PK activity was inhibited by the addition of pefabloc (Roche). Dilutions of the PK treated extract were then added to the cells for four days. After that time the extract was removed and the washed with fresh medium which was then replaced. The cells were then incubated for a further seven days before the cells were harvested again by scraping the cells from the wells. The cells were extracted in PBS with 1&#x00025; igepal. Extracts were divided into two halves. Half of which was treated with PK before electrophoresis, western blot and immunodetection for PrP.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dimitri Gateff for technical
