A potential mechanism for loss of visual acuity may be due to light scattering from disruption of normal protein&#x02013;protein interactions. During aging, the lens accumulates extensively deamidated crystallins. We have previously reported that deamidation in the &#x003b2;A3-crystallin (&#x003b2;A3) dimer decreased the stability of the dimer in vitro. The purpose of the present study was to investigate if deamidation altered the interaction of &#x003b2;A3 with other &#x003b2;-crystallin subunits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Deamidation was mimicked by replacing glutamines, Q85 and Q180, at the predicted interacting interface between &#x003b2;A3 domains with glutamic acids by site-directed mutagenesis. Human recombinant wild type &#x003b2;A3 or the doubly deamidated mutant &#x003b2;A3 Q85E/Q180E (DM &#x003b2;A3) were mixed with either &#x003b2;B1- or &#x003b2;B2-crystallin (&#x003b2;B1 or &#x003b2;B2) subunits.

Numerous types of modifications have been identified and include truncation, methylation, oxidation, disulfide bond formation, advanced glycation end products, and deamidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. These modifications change the structure and stability of lens proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the intact lens, the major structural proteins, called crystallins, are tightly packed in a very high concentration of 300&#x02013;500&#x000a0;mg/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. However, upon processing of the lens, crystallins separate into soluble and insoluble fractions, with the insoluble proteins increasing during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Modifications increase in the insoluble proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>], suggesting a potential mechanism for compromised lens function.</p><p>Of the potential post-translational modifications, deamidation is one of the major modifications in the lens and is significantly increased in aged and cataractous lenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Deamidation sites have been identified in every crystallin, and are particularly prevalent in &#x003b2;-crystallins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. For example, at least nine deamidation sites have been identified in &#x003b2;A3-crystallin (&#x003b2;A3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, several deamidation sites are greater in the insoluble than in the soluble proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], strongly suggesting an association between deamidation and insolubilization. The exact cause for insolubilization is not known, but may involve disruption of the normal interactions between &#x003b2;-crystallins.</p><p>The &#x003b2;-crystallins are comprised of seven polypeptide chains, &#x003b2;A1-, &#x003b2;A2-, &#x003b2;A3-, &#x003b2;A4-, &#x003b2;B1-, &#x003b2;B2-, and &#x003b2;B3-crystallin that when isolated in vitro form complex hetero-oligomers of dimers, &#x003b2;Low- (&#x003b2;L), and higher-ordered oligomers, &#x003b2;High-crystallin (&#x003b2;H) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. During normal maturation and aging, a hetero-oligomer intermediate in size between &#x003b2;L and &#x003b2;H increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>] and is associated with post-translational modifications.</p><p>Two different &#x003b2;-crystallin dimer structures have been resolved by crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Dimers are comprised of two domains connected by a short linker peptide that is either bent as in &#x003b2;B1-crystallin (&#x003b2;B1) or extended as in &#x003b2;B2-crystallin (&#x003b2;B2). Each domain has two Greek key motifs comprised of &#x003b2;-strands. This interface has been well characterized, particularly in &#x003b2;B2, and hydrophobic interactions with salt bridges are thought to stabilize the interacting interface of the dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Similar interactions most likely occur between different &#x003b2;-subunits. &#x003b2;B1 and &#x003b2;B2 have been reported to make hetero-oligomers with &#x003b2;A3 in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>].</p><p>We have previously reported the effects of deamidation at the critical interacting interface in &#x003b2;-crystallins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Stability was significantly decreased due to deamidation, without the homo-dimer dissociating. Deamidation introduces a negative charge at physiologic pH and most likely created a cavity or space at the interface that contributed to the structural changes that decreased stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of deamidation at the interface in &#x003b2;A3 on subunit-subunit interactions with other &#x003b2;-subunits to mimic the more complex interactions found in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Expression and purification of recombinant protein</title><p>Wild type (WT) human &#x003b2;-crystallins, &#x003b2;B1, &#x003b2;B2, and &#x003b2;A3, were recombinantly expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>].

This is significant because deamidation may disrupt higher-ordered oligomers necessary for lens transparency and contribute to the accumulation of deamidated crystallins in the insoluble proteins observed in aged and cataractous lenses. While much is known about the effects of post-translational modifications on homo-oligomers, little is known about the effects on the more relevant hetero-oligomer interactions. We have previously reported that deamidations on the surface of &#x003b2;A3 altered its oligomerization with &#x003b2;B1 dependent on the site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>].

In the absence of &#x003b2;B1, DM &#x003b2;A3 rapidly precipitated at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. At the concentrations used, &#x003b2;A3 dimers were mixed with &#x003b2;B1 monomers and dimers that then formed hetero-oligomers. Because deamidated &#x003b2;A3 crystallin was not heat stable alone, the increased stability, can be attributed to the formation of the interactions with &#x003b2;B1 crystallin in the hetero-oligomer.</p><p>A stabilizing affect was not seen with &#x003b2;B2, as would be expected since &#x003b2;B2 did not form a hetero-oligomer with DM &#x003b2;A3 at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Even though &#x003b2;B2 is more heat stable than DM &#x003b2;A3, it was not able to prevent the precipitation of DM &#x003b2;A3. In contrast, both &#x003b2;B1 and &#x003b2;B2 were able to prevent the thermal denaturation of WT &#x003b2;A3. &#x003b2;B1 appears to be a better &#x0201c;solubilizing partner&#x0201d; than &#x003b2;B2. Because &#x003b2;B1 did not prevent the precipitation of ALDH, it&#x02019;s stabilizing properties are most likely related to its ability to subunit exchange with the &#x003b2;A3 homo-dimer.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions between &#x003b2;-crystallin subunits</title><p>Both WT &#x003b2;A3 and deamidated &#x003b2;A3 formed tetramers with &#x003b2;B1. The molar masses and asymmetric shape of the eluted &#x003b2;B1-&#x003b2;A3 hetero-oligomer peak during SEC-MALS suggested a mixture of hetero-tetramers and hetero-dimers, as has previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. The &#x003b2;B1-WT &#x003b2;A3 and &#x003b2;B1-DM &#x003b2;A3 hetero-oligomers migrated similarly on BN-PAGE suggesting similar shapes. Far CD and fluorescence analysis also indicated the hetero-oligomers had similar secondary and tertiary structures.</p><p>The predicted structures of &#x003b2;B1 and &#x003b2;B2 from crystallography are known and differ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], while the structure of &#x003b2;A3 is not known. Of interest, then, is that the CD spectra of the &#x003b2;B1-&#x003b2;A3 hetero-oligomer more closely matched that of &#x003b2;B1 with minima at both 205 and 218 nm. Since, truncated &#x003b2;B1 shows a single minimum at 218 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>], the double minima of the &#x003b2;B1-&#x003b2;A3 complex reflects the contribution of the long NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal extension of &#x003b2;B1. It cannot be said from these data if the complex also has a bent linker as does the &#x003b2;B1 homo-dimer.</p><p>We have previously reported structural changes in DM &#x003b2;A3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>], which was further supported here by its differing migration from WT &#x003b2;A3 on BN-PAGE. Deamidation by introducing a negative charge at the predicted hydrophobic interface in &#x003b2;A3 disrupted its structure and decreased interaction with &#x003b2;B1without completely preventing formation of a mixed oligomer. Therefore, deamidation at the predicted interface in the &#x003b2;A3 dimer is also important in the formation of the &#x003b2;A3-&#x003b2;B1 hetero-oligomer.</p><p>In contrast to &#x003b2;B1, &#x003b2;B2 formed a hetero-dimer with WT &#x003b2;A3 or DM &#x003b2;A3. The hetero-dimer migrated on BN-PAGE as a faint band between the &#x003b2;B2 dimer and &#x003b2;A3 dimer, suggesting the shape was less elongated than the &#x003b2;B2 extended dimer. There was also a slight difference in migration between the &#x003b2;B2-WT &#x003b2;A3 and &#x003b2;B2-DM &#x003b2;A3 dimers, suggesting different shapes of the mixed complexes.</p><p>In summary, deamidation decreased formation of hetero-oligomers between &#x003b2;-crystallin subunits with specific &#x003b2;-crystallin interactions protective against insolubilization. An excess accumulation of deamidated &#x003b2;-crystallins in vivo may disrupt normal protein&#x02013;protein interactions and diminish the stabilizing effects between them, thus, contributing to the accumulation of insoluble &#x003b2;-crystallins during aging and cataracts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support by NIH/NEI R01-EY012239 (K.J.L.), NIH/NCRR P20RR016454 (Dr. Julie T.
