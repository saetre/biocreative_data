Eleven cDNA clones were isolated, which included genes encoding two previously characterised and six novel PP1 binding proteins. Three of the cDNAs encoded a protein called host cell factor (HCF), which is an essential component of the cellular complex required for the transcription of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate-early (IE) genes. We demonstrate that HCF and PP1 exist as a complex in nuclear extracts and that this complex is distinct from the form of HCF that associates with HSV VP16. The data suggest novel roles for HCF and PP1, which may be relevant to their functions in transcription and cell cycle progression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The transcription of the immediate-early (IE) genes of herpes simplex virus (HSV) involves the formation of a multi-protein complex containing a structural component of HSV (VP16), and the cellular proteins oct1 and host cell factor (HCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c2">2</xref>). HCF is a family of related polypeptides ranging in size from 110 to 300 kDa. These polypeptides are all encoded by a single gene and are generated by processing of a 300 kDa-precursor protein by site-specific cleavages located within a repetitive peptide sequence of about 20 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c4">4</xref>). HCF is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c9">9</xref>) but its cellular function is not yet clear. The protein&#x02019;s conservation and its interaction with cellular and viral transcription factors indicates a role in the regulation of expression of cellular genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c12">12</xref>). Furthermore, HCF has also been implicated in the regulation of the G<sub>0</sub>&#x0002f;G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Cellular transcription factors are frequently modified by phosphorylation, resulting in a diverse range of effects including alteration in subcellular localisation and the modulation of both the DNA binding and transcriptional regulatory domains. For example, VP16, the viral protein that interacts with oct1 and HCF to form the TRF-C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c19">19</xref>) is phosphorylated in virally infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c21">21</xref>) and this phosphorylation may be directed by cellular kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c25">25</xref>). Mutation of a phosphorylation site (serine 375) of VP16 to alanine abolishes complex assembly with Oct1 and HCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c25">25</xref>).</p><p>The reversible phosphorylation of proteins is an important mechanism for the regulation of various cellular metabolic pathways. The phosphorylation status of each protein substrate is maintained by complex regulatory interactions involving specific kinases and phosphatases. In some instances these interactions may involve the targeting of kinases and phosphatases to specific subcellular locations in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c27">27</xref>). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is an important member of the family of serine&#x0002f;threonine phosphatases and had been shown to be involved in the regulation of several cellular processes and pathways in mammalian cells such as glycogen metabolism, muscle contraction, protein synthesis, cell division and calcium transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c29">29</xref>). PP1 is also thought to regulate nuclear processes such as pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c30">30</xref>) and the progression and exit from mitosis in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Members of the serine&#x0002f;threonine protein phosphatase 1 family have a highly conserved catalytic subunit that shows a broad substrate specificity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c28">28</xref>). Several cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c33">33</xref>) and nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c39">39</xref>) proteins have been identified that may play a role in the subcellular location and the determination of substrate specificity of this enzyme. These interacting proteins that regulate PP1 activity have been named targeting subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c26">26</xref>).</p><p>In order to identify new PP1 targeting subunits, we have screened a HeLa cDNA expression library using the digoxygenin (DIG)-labelled catalytic subunit of PP1. In addition to previously characterised PP1 regulatory proteins, several novel PP1 binding proteins were detected, including HCF. We show that HCF exhibits characteristics of a PP1 regulatory or targeting protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Labelling of protein phosphatase 1 with digoxigenin</title><p>The human PP1 catalytic subunit (gamma isoform) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c40">40</xref>), was labelled with digoxigenin-3-<italic>O</italic>-methylcarbonyl-aminocaproic-acid-<italic>N</italic>-hydroxy-succinamide ester (Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c41">41</xref>). Approximately 30 &#x000b5;g of PP1 were incubated with 5.5 &#x000b5;l of digoxigenin ester (1 mg&#x0002f;ml) in a total volume of 200 &#x000b5;l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 8.5, with constant shaking for 1 h.

The plates were then incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for ~16&#x02013;20 h until the colonies were ~1&#x02013;2 mm in diameter. The colonies were transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filters (Amersham) and incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 2 h to induce expression of the fusion proteins. The colonies were then lysed on the filters by placing on 3MM Whatman paper impregnated with 5&#x00025; SDS in an oven at 80&#x000b0;C for 25 min. The filters were washed in PBS containing 10&#x00025; fat-free dry milk and 1 mM benzamidine (Sigma) for 5 min. A second wash was performed in the same buffer containing 10 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml DNAse I (Sigma) for 5 min. The filters were washed once more with the same buffer but without DNase. The filters were incubated in PBS buffer containing 10&#x00025; fat-free milk for 1 h to block any remaining protein adsorption sites. The wash buffer was discarded and the filters incubated in fresh binding buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;Cl pH 7.6 and 1 mg&#x0002f;ml BSA. Digoxigenin-labelled PP1-&#x003b3; was added to the binding buffer to give a final concentration of 1 &#x000b5;g of enzyme per millilitre. The binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 2&#x02013;17 h. After the binding incubation, the filters were washed six times for 25 min with shaking at room temperature in binding buffer without BSA. The filters were then incubated in PBS containing 2&#x00025; fat-free milk and mouse anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) for 1 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The filters were washed four times for 5 min each in PBS and then a further incubation in 2&#x00025; milk in PBS containing horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG was performed for 1 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membranes were finally washed four times for 5 min each in PBS. The filters were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham) and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak) according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Spots on the films corresponding to positive colonies were marked and the appropriate colonies were picked from the plates and subjected to several rounds of plating and reprobing until distinct and well separated positive colonies could be obtained.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterisation of PP1-binding colonies</title><p>Colonies were grown in LB medium containing 50 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml of ampicillin and plasmid DNA prepared from the bacteria using standard methods.

A mixture of the conjugated peptides was used to immunise sheep (SAPU) for the production of polyclonal antisera.

Immunoprecipitations of the HCF complex from nuclear extract were performed using either anti-rHCF antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c7">7</xref>) or HC2. 100 &#x000b5;l of nuclear extract (4&#x02013;5 mg&#x0002f;ml) was precleared for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C on 25 &#x000b5;l of settled protein G Sepharose (Amersham-Pharmacia) or protein G agarose beads (Roche) that had been preincubated with ~10 &#x000b5;g of sheep pre-immune IgG. The precleared nuclear extract was diluted 10 times with PBS buffer containing 0.5&#x00025; Triton X-100 before adding protein-G Sepharose or agarose beads that had been preincubated with ~5 &#x000b5;g of antibody HC2 for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C.

The immune precipitates were then digested with trypsin to release any bound phosphatase activity. The digestion reaction was started by the addition of 1 &#x000b5;l of 0.1 mg&#x0002f;ml trypsin (11 000 U&#x0002f;mg, Sigma) and after incubation at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 &#x000b5;l (1 mg&#x0002f;ml) soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). This resulted in the release of free active, C-terminally nicked PP1 catalytic subunit.

Eleven cDNAs were identified that express polypeptides that bind DIG-PP1. Each clone was purified through at least three rounds of expression screening until all colonies were positive for binding DIG&#x02013;PP1. The cDNA inserts from each positive clone were then sequenced. The validity of this screening method was confirmed when two of the 11 positive clones were found to encode previously characterised PP1 binding proteins, i.e. NIPP1 and FB-19&#x0002f;P99&#x0002f;PNUTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c39">39</xref>). The other clones encoded six separate genes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd180tb1">1</xref>). One of these is a novel gene for which we have retrieved EST (expressed sequence tag) sequences in the database of expressed sequence tags (dBEST) corresponding to this cDNA. For the remaining five clones, we were able to retrieve full-length cDNA sequences that code for each of these proteins in the non-redundant (NR) database of Genebank (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd180tb1">1</xref>). None of these proteins have previously been shown to interact with PP1. Interestingly, three of the 11 positive clones expressed fragments of the nuclear protein HCF (clones 1, 15 and 17; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f1">1</xref>). Furthermore, all three clones encoded overlapping C-terminal fragments of HCF indicating that the PP1 binding site is likely present in the region of overlap. HCF is known to interact with cellular and viral transcription factors and is proposed to have possible roles in gene expression and cell cycle progression. It was not known to bind or regulate PP1. We decided therefore to characterise the interaction of PP1 and HCF because it may shed light on the normal cellular role of this factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the interaction between HCF and PP1</title><p>Clone 17 contains the smallest cDNA fragment of HCF of the three cDNAs obtained in this screen. To confirm the interaction of this HCF fragment with DIG&#x02013;PP1, protein lysates from bacteria either expressing the fusion protein, a non-expressing control or a positive control corresponding to cells expressing a &#x003b2;-GAL&#x02013;NIPP1 fusion, were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with the DIG&#x02013;PP1 probe, which confirmed that PP1 interacts directly with the C-terminus of HCF (residues 1604&#x02013;1956) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f2">2</xref>A).</p><p>The library screening and far-western analyses were performed under denaturing conditions. We therefore determined if PP1 and HCF would interact in solution using a GST pull-down assay. The HCF fragment of clone 17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f1">1</xref>) was cloned in frame with GST (Materials and Methods) and the resulting GST&#x02013;HCF fusion protein purified and immobilized on glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose beads. Bacterially expressed PP1 was then incubated with either the GST&#x02013;HCF beads or control GST alone beads. As a positive control, PP1 binding to GST&#x02013;p53BP2 beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c33">33</xref>) was also tested. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were released with 1&#x00025; SDS then resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane and PP1 detected by immunoblotting with an anti-PP1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f2">2</xref>B). This shows that PP1, when bacterially expressed, binds directly to GST&#x02013;HCF and to GST&#x02013;p53BP2, but not to GST alone (lanes 1 and 2). Taken together with the library screening data, we conclude that PP1 interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with HCF and this interaction depends upon a sequence contained within HCF between amino acids 1604 and 1956.</p><p>We next examined whether endogenous HCF and PP1 exist in a stable complex in HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f2">2</xref>C). HCF was immunoprecipitated from a HeLa nuclear extract and the immune complexes resolved by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. After transfer to a membrane, HCF and PP1 were each detected by immunoblotting with the respective antibodies. This shows that PP1 is specifically immunoprecipitated along with HCF, indicating that a common complex containing both HCF and PP1 is present in a crude nuclear extract (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f2">2</xref>C). However, we note that only a small amount of the total PP1 in nuclear extract is associated with HCF. This is not surprising because major forms of nuclear PP1 are known which have the catalytic PP1 subunit bound to either of the nuclear regulators NIPP1 or FB19&#x0002f;p99&#x0002f;pNUTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c38">38</xref> and references therein).</p></sec><sec><title>Native HCF complex contains a protein phosphatase activity</title><p>Since HCF and PP1 can co-exist as a complex in nuclear extract, we next tested whether the anti-HCF antibody can co-immunoprecipitate protein phosphatase activity. Initial protein phosphatase assays, using <sup>32</sup>P-labelled rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase a as substrate, showed only background levels of phosphatase activity in anti-HCF immunoprecipitates (data not shown and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f3">3</xref>A, lane 3). One possible reason for this is that the catalytic activity of the PP1 in this complex is inhibited as seen for forms of PP1 bound to other regulatory subunits. Tryptic cleavage can be used to remove inhibitory proteins from a complex with PP1 because the catalytic activity of PP1 is not affected by cleavage of the protein with trypsin. Treatment of the anti-HCF immunoprecipitates with trypsin resulted in a &#x0003e;20-fold increase in protein phosphatase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f3">3</xref>A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the PP1 activity in the complex with HCF is inhibited, at least towards standard assay substrates such as phosphorylase a. In this regard HCF behaves similarly to the other known nuclear PP1 regulators, NIPP1 and p99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c39">39</xref>). We observe that increasing the amount of anti-HCF antibody used for immunoprecipitation results in a parallel increase in both the protein phosphatase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f3">3</xref>B) and the amount of HCF polypeptides recovered in the immune complex (data not shown). This provides further evidence that a form of nuclear PP1 that contains HCF is present in HeLa nuclei.</p><p>HeLa nuclear extracts have been shown to contain both endogenous PP1 and PP2A activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c46">46</xref>). To confirm that the protein phosphatase activity released by trypsinization of the HCF immunoprecipitate is PP1 and not PP2A, the samples were treated with specific protein phosphatase inhibitors. PP2A is inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid, whereas PP1 is less sensitive to this inhibitor, requiring micromolar amounts of okadaic acid for complete inhibition. Conversely, inhibitor 2 is a potent inhibitor of PP1 but has no effect on PP2A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c28">28</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f3">3</xref>C shows that 5 &#x000b5;M but not 2 nM okadaic acid was able to inhibit the phosphatase activity released by trypsin treatment of an anti-HCF immunoprecipitate. In addition, 0.5 &#x000b5;M inhibitor 2 completely abolished the phosphatase activity associated with HCF. Taken together, these data suggest that most or all of the phosphatase activity associated with HCF in these assays is a form of PP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of a peptide containing a consensus PP1-binding motif on the HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex in nuclear extract</title><p>The PP1 binding region of HCF (clone 17) shares no apparent sequence similarity with any of the previously characterised PP1 binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c47">47</xref>). To investigate whether there was any higher order structural conservation in the PP1 binding domain between HCF and the other PP1 binding proteins, we performed a competition experiment. A synthetic peptide containing the putative PP1 binding domain of p53BP2 has previously been used to characterise the PP1 binding domain of the nuclear PP1 regulator p99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c38">38</xref>). By competition, this peptide is able to disrupt the p99&#x02013;PP1 complex, thus releasing free PP1 activity. Other studies have also shown that peptides containing this motif can bind to PP1 and are capable of disrupting or attenuating the effects of PP1-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c48">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c51">51</xref>). Thus, endogenous HCF was immunoprecipitated from HeLa nuclear extract, challenged with p53BP2 peptide and then assayed for PP1 activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f4">4</xref>A). This showed that the p53BP2 peptide caused release of PP1 activity. However, HCF immune complexes treated with either buffer or control peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c38">38</xref>) did not release any phosphatase activity. To determine the extent of competitive PP1 release by the peptide, after the treatment with the p53BP2 or control peptides, the immune complexes were subsequently trypsinised. After challenge with either buffer or control peptide, trypsin treatment released comparable levels of PP1 activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f4">4</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5). However, the anti-HCF immunoprecipitate challenged with the p53BP2 peptide showed as expected less increase in PP1 activity upon trypsin treatment (lane 6) because much of the PP1 had already been removed by treatment with the p53BP2 peptide. We estimate that ~65&#x00025; of the PP1 activity in the HCF complex was released by the p53BP2 peptide, with the remaining 35&#x00025; released by trypsinising the HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex. Despite the absence of an obvious PP1 binding motif in HCF, the peptide competition data suggest that HCF interacts with PP1 through either the same or else a closely overlapping binding site to that recognised by p53BP2, p99 and other PP1 regulators. In summary, we conclude that a peptide containing a consensus PP1-binding motif can disrupt the HCF&#x02013;PP1 interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>The HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex and the HCF&#x02013;VP16 induced complex</title><p>HCF was originally identified as a key cellular component involved in the recruitment of HSV VP16 to the TAATGARAT sequences located upstream of the IE genes of HSV. Indeed, HCF can be partially purified due to its ability to bind directly to VP16. We next investigated if there was any relationship between the PP1-binding activity of HCF and the role of HCF in VP16-mediated transcription complex formation. HCF was isolated by either GST-VP16 affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation with anti-HCF antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f5">5</xref>A). The isolated proteins were separated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, transferred to a membrane and analysed by immunoblotting with either anti-HCF antibody (upper panel) or anti-PP1 antibody (lower panel). Surprisingly, PP1 was only associated with the HCF isolated by immunoprecipitation, and not in the HCF fraction that was isolated through its binding to VP16. To characterise further the VP16&#x02013;HCF and PP1&#x02013;HCF interactions, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays to analyse the VP16-induced complex at a TAATGARAT DNA element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f5">5</xref>B, lanes 2&#x02013;4). Incubation of HeLa cell nuclear extract with labelled probe produced a complex corresponding to the previously described interaction of Oct 1 with this sequence. Addition of GST-VP16 caused formation of a complex of lower mobility. This complex required HCF because it is disrupted by the addition of anti-HCF antibody (data not shown). In contrast, neither anti-PP1 nor anti-PP2A antibodies had any effect on the VP16-induced complex (data not shown). Addition of excess active bacterially expressed PP1 had no effect on the VP16-induced complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd180f5">5</xref>B, lanes 6&#x02013;8). Also we observed that the p53BP2 peptide had no effect on the ability of GST-VP16 to form a complex with HCF in nuclear extract (data not shown). This suggests that PP1 and VP16 are not competing for the same binding site in HCF and is consistent with the absence of PP1 in the HCF complexed with VP16; i.e.&#x000a0;PP1 does not form part of the HCF-containing VP16-induced transcription complex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we report the identification of eight human genes encoding PP1 binding proteins by screening a HeLa cDNA expression library in <italic>E.coli</italic> using digoxigenin-labelled PP1 as a probe. Two of the genes isolated encoded the previously described PP1 regulatory proteins NIPP1 and FB19&#x0002f;p99. One of the genes has not been previously reported and only its EST sequences are available in the sequence databases. The other five have full-length cDNA sequences in the databases but have never been shown to interact with or regulate the activity of any protein phosphatases. One of these, for which we isolated three independent cDNA clones encoded the protein HCF, a cellular factor implicated in transcription and cell cycle progression mechanisms. We characterised further the interaction between HCF and PP1 because this may offer new clues about the cellular role of HCF.</p><p>We detected an endogenous complex in HeLa nuclear extract that contains both HCF and PP1. However, in this complex PP1 activity towards phosphorylase a is inhibited and had to be released by treatment of the complex with trypsin. This indicates that the complex may contain a regulated form of nuclear PP1 activity. Because we also show that a fragment of HCF including amino acids 1604&#x02013;1956 binds directly to PP1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, it is likely that HCF may act as a regulator of PP1 activity. These data suggest a new cellular function for HCF. It remains to be determined if HCF inhibits the activity of PP1 towards all substrates or if it, instead, restricts its substrate specificity and&#x0002f;or directs PP1 activity towards a specific substrate(s). Indeed, this is a feature of many PP1 regulatory proteins. Given the role of both HCF and PP1 in the cell cycle, one possibility is that their association might be involved in regulating cell cycle progression. HCF cDNA codes for a high molecular mass protein (~300 kDa) and attempts to express the full-length protein in <italic>E.coli</italic> have been unsuccessful. We observed that the recombinant C-terminal fragments of HCF that bind PP1 were not sufficient to inhibit the enzyme&#x02019;s activity towards phosphorylase a. It is possible that the recombinant fragment is inactive in regulating the activity of PP1 because it lacks some post-translational modification or the regulatory domain is located at a different region of the HCF molecule. Alternatively, the HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex may contain a third component that suppresses PP1 activity.</p><p>Previous studies of HCF have concentrated on its interaction with the viral protein VP16 and its involvement in the expression of the IE genes of HSV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c18">18</xref>). Interestingly, we did not detect PP1 within the HCF complex that associates with VP16 even though HCF purified by VP16-affinity chromatography was capable of binding PP1 (data not shown). Furthermore, PP1 was not present in the HCF-containing complex that forms at the TAATGARAT DNA element. One possible explanation for these data is that distinct forms of the HCF complex exist and that the form that associates with VP16 is devoid of PP1 or the binding of VP16 to HCF may inhibit the protein&#x02019;s binding to PP1. The latter possibility could not be investigated further due to problems in expressing full-length HCF in bacteria. Also, neither DIG&#x02013;PP1 binding to membrane bound HCF nor the HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex in immunoprecipitates were affected by addition of VP16 (data not shown). This means that if VP16 displaced PP1 from HCF <italic>in vivo</italic>, this may involve interactions with other proteins. We found that PP1 associates with the C-terminus of HCF, whereas the N-terminus of HCF has been shown to be sufficient for VP16-induced complex (VIC) formation and transcriptional activation of HSV IE genes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c52">52</xref>). We also found that the p53BP2 peptide was unable to dissociate the VP16&#x02013;HCF complex in a GST-VP16 pull-down assay (data not shown) although it released PP1 from the HCF&#x02013;PP1 complex in HeLa nuclear extract. Taken together, these data would likely rule out simple competition by VP16 and PP1 for binding to the same site in HCF. It has been reported that treatment of purified HCF with potato acid phosphatase disrupts the interaction with VP16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c19">19</xref>). It is possible that PP1-bound HCF is dephosphorylated (possibly even by PP1 itself) and is therefore not a substrate for the VP16-induced complex. Another possibility is that VP16 displaces the PP1 from HCF by causing a conformational change that would disrupt interaction with other regions of HCF. This latter possibility is intriguing because, although the N-terminus of HCF is sufficient to interact with VP16, a role for the C-terminus of HCF in modulating the interaction has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c9">9</xref>). Thus, it is possible that VP16 can disrupt the interaction between HCF and PP1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby deregulating PP1 activity.</p><p>Interestingly, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) expresses a protein called &#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>34.5 that binds avidly to PP1 and it has been suggested that this interaction redirects PP1 to dephosphorylate elF-2&#x003b1; to enable continued protein synthesis in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c53">53</xref>). It is possible that an HSV1 PP1-binding protein, such as &#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>34.5, may recruit PP1 from other binding proteins in virally infected cells, thus making more phosphorylated HCF available to interact with VP16. Increased levels of phosphorylated HCF will favour the activation of transcription of the viral IE genes. It would be of interest to further investigate if there is any difference in the phosphorylation status of HCF in the HCF&#x02013;PP1 and the HCF&#x02013;VP16 complexes. Alternatively, HCF&#x02013;PP1 may regulate the dephosphorylation of VP16 thus rendering the protein inactive and unable to interact with HCF in the formation of the VP16-induced complex. Indeed, it has been shown that a single serine residue at position 375 of VP16 is a target for casein kinase II phosphorylation and that phosphorylation at this site is critical for the assembly of VP16 in a complex with Oct-1 and HCF. A mutation of serine 375 to alanine abolishes the activity of VP16 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c25">25</xref>). This may account for the absence of PP1 in the VP16&#x02013;HCF complex in HeLa nuclear extract. Given the role of PP1 in cell cycle progression, such a model would be consistent with the changes in cell cycle observed upon HSV infection. Perhaps, in addition to exploiting HCF to target VP16 to the HSV IE promoter, VP16 deregulates normal HCF cellular functions in a manner akin to other viral transcription factors such as adenovirus E1a. For example E1a targets the CBP&#x0002f;p300 transcription factors to disrupt their normal cellular activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c54">54</xref>). Further experiments will be required to test these possibilities.</p><p>The sequence of the HCF binding region contained in our smallest HCF clone does not contain the consensus PP1 binding domain motif that has been observed in most of the previously identified PP1 regulatory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c47">47</xref>). Of the five other novel PP1-binding proteins identified in the cDNA expression library screen, four either have the R&#x0002f;K-V&#x0002f;I-x-F&#x0002f;W motif or amino acid sequences that are closely related to the PP1-binding consensus domain motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c55">55</xref>). Our attempts to identify a simple linear sequence motif that may be responsible for the binding of PP1 by HCF have so far not been successful although the peptide competition data indicate that HCF may bind to either the same or else a closely overlapping site on PP1 as that bound by other regulatory proteins. However, the previously identified PP1 binding protein inhibitor-2 does not contain the consensus PP1 binding motif as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd180c56">56</xref>). It is possible that there may be some structural similarity between the PP1-binding domains of these proteins that is not apparent at the level of primary amino acid sequence. Further structural studies of PP1-interacting proteins should shed light on the nature of the PP1-binding domain.</p><p>In summary, we have identified HCF as a likely nuclear PP1 regulatory protein. This suggests several novel possibilities concerning the role of HCF in transcription and cell cycle control. These findings prompt new lines of investigation for future studies into the normal cellular function of HCF and its role upon HSV infection.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd180f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Linear representation of HCF showing the three overlapping clones that interact with PP1-&#x003b3;.
