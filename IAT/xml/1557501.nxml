In particular, electroporation is attractive, because it is an easy and inexpensive method that requires only a plasmid and a device for performing electroporation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, the method does not require viral vectors, expensive proteins, or carrier matrices. Previously, we constructed a human BMP-2 gene expression vector (pCAGGS-BMP-2) and showed that transferring the BMP-2 gene into rat skeletal muscles by <italic>in vivo </italic>transcutaneous electroporation induced ectopic bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, there was no significant relationship between the dose of pCAGGS-BMP-2 plasmid vector used and the volume, quality, or time course of the ectopic bone formation. In this model, the surface area the electrodes can cover restricts the volume of the injected plasmid to 50 &#x003bc;l. Furthermore, any interaction between the plasmid dose and the electrical parameters can affect the efficiency of the gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For clinical applications, it is important to optimize the method to enhance bone formation at the level of the intrinsic osteoinductive activity.</p><p>Comparative analyses of the osteogenic activity of various human BMP adenoviral vectors have indicated that each BMP has a different potential to induce bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In culture, protein purified from the supernatant of adenoviral vector-infected epithelial cells expressing both BMP-2 and BMP-7 accelerates the differentiation of preosteoblastic or premyogenic cells into osteoblastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, culture supernatant from CHO cells that were transiently transfected with equal amounts of BMP-2 and BMP-7 expression vectors induces maximal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in a mouse stromal cell culture system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These researchers concluded that the combined transfer of the BMP-2 and BMP-7 genes to epithelial cells such as CHO or 293 cells produces the heterodimer BMP-2/7, and that it is the BMP-2/7 in the supernatant that enhances the differentiation of the preosteoblastic or myoblastic cells into osteogenic cells, leading to osteoinduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, there are few reports of the effect on bone formation of the simultaneous and direct gene transfer of two or more BMPs. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the combined gene transfer of BMP-2 and BMP-7 into skeletal muscles in rats using <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation could induce ectopic bone formation more rapidly than the transfer of only one of these genes. In addition, the endogenous BMP-4 mRNA expression levels and BMP-4-expressing cells were examined, since several reports show that exogenous BMPs elevate the levels of other BMPs or BMP-4 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Prior to the <italic>in vivo </italic>study mentioned above, the effect of the combined direct gene transfer of BMP-2 and BMP-7 into myoblastic cells was also assessed using an <italic>in vitro </italic>gene-transfer system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid vector</title><p>Human BMP-7 cDNA was obtained by PCR with pUC BMP-7 as the template and the following primers: human BMP-7 forward primer, 5'-GAG AGA GAG <italic>AAGCTT </italic>GGA TCC <underline>ATG</underline> GTG GCC GGG ACC CGC (<underline>ATG</underline>, initial codon); human BMP-7 backward primer, 5'-AGA GAG AG <italic>AAGCTT </italic><underline>CTA</underline> GTG GCA GCC ACA GGC CCG GAC CA (<underline>CTA</underline>, stop codon).

The cells were cultured at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells per well in 12-well plates in 1 ml growth medium (DMEM, 15% fetal bovine serum) for 1 day before the transfection. The next day, 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS and 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-2, 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS and 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-7, or 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-2 and 0.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-7 were diluted in 100 &#x003bc;l Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, California, USA), then mixed with 4.0 &#x003bc;l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, California, USA) in 100 &#x003bc;l Opti-MEM. These DNA-lipofectamine 2000 complexes were added to each well of 90% confluent C2C12 cells. One day after the transfection, the medium was changed. At 10 days after the transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the cells from two 12-well plates were collected. The cells were lysed with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 M NaCl, 0.5 M EDTA, 0.5 M NaF, and 10% Nonident P-40. The lysates were spun and the supernatant collected. The quantitative ALP activity data and total protein content of the supernatants were determined by the p-nitrophenyl phosphate method. One 12-well plate was used for the histochemical staining of ALP, performed using a Sigma diagnostic ALP kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Nine-week-old male Wistar rats were purchased from Kurea (Osaka, Japan) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in our animal facility.

The fur on the target area of the leg was removed with clippers. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, plate electrodes (Nepa Gene, Chiba, Japan) consisting of pairs of stainless steel plates with a fixed length of 5 mm were attached to the skin at the target site after being coated with keratin cream (Fukuda Denshi, Tokyo, Japan). The accuracy of the electric current applied was confirmed by measuring the resistance (usually below 800 &#x003a9;) between the electrodes, which surrounded the middle of the gastrocnemius muscle. Next, 50 &#x003bc;l of plasmid DNA (total 25 &#x003bc;g): 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS and 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-2, 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS and 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-7, 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-2 and 12.5 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS-BMP-7, or 25 &#x003bc;g pCAGGS was injected with a 30-gauge needle into the center of the muscle between the electrodes. Electroporation was started immediately after the injection by applying 8 electrical pulses (100 V, 50 msec): four square pulses followed by 4 more of the opposite polarity at 1-sec intervals using an electroporator (CUY21EDIT; Nepa Gene).</p></sec><sec><title>Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR</title><p>Rats (each group N = 5) that had received injections of pCAGGS and pCAGGS-BMP-2, pCAGGS and pCAGGS-BMP-7, pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7, or pCAGGS alone were killed under general anesthesia and the target muscles were resected (0.15 g) at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days after gene transfer. Total RNA was isolated from the targeted muscle using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). mRNAs for human BMP-2, human BMP-7, rat BMP-4, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were detected by RT-PCR using the following primers: human BMP-2 backward primer, 5'-TCTCTGTTTCAGGCCGAACA-3'; human BMP-2 forward primer, 5'-TCTGACTGACCGCGTTACTC-3'; human BMP-7 backward primer, 5'-CAAGCCCAAAATGGAGAGGA-3'; human BMP-7 forward primer, 5'-TCTGACTGACCGCGTTACTC-3'; rat BMP-4 backward primer, 5'-TTCTCCAGATGTTCTTCGTG-3'; rat BMP-4 forward primer, 5'-ACTGCCGCAGCTTCTCTGAG-3'; G3PDH backward primer, 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'; G3PDH forward primer, 5'-ACTGGCGTCTTCACCACCAT-3'. The human BMP-2 and BMP-7 forward primers were designed to hybridize with the sequence immediately downstream of the transcriptional start site of the CAG promoter, so the PCR products were not contaminated by plasmid or genomic DNA. RNA (1 &#x003bc;g) was incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 hr in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l and then at 94&#x000b0;C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 55&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min. The PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis to detect the 285-bp human BMP-2 mRNA, 279-bp human BMP-7 mRNA, 546-bp rat BMP-4 mRNA, and 682-bp G3PDH mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Radiographic analysis</title><p>Ten days after the gene transfer, the rats (each group N = 6) were sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital.

For immunohistochemical detection of BMP-4, serial sections were rehydrated and immersed in 0.5% periodic acid solution for 10 min to eliminate the non-specific reaction by endogenous peroxidase, then incubated in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, and washed with PBS. They were then incubated with an anti-BMP-4 monoclonal antibody (Novocastra laboratories, Newcastle, United Kingdom) diluted 1:400. Antibody incubation was carried out for 12 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and the sections were rinsed several times before incubating them with peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) diluted 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature.

By 10 days after the treatment, both cartilaginous tissues and bone had formed in specimens treated with pCAGGS and pCAGGS-BMP-2 or pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7. However, in specimens from rats that received pCAGGS-BMP-2, the cartilaginous regions, rather than ossified regions, were predominant and widely distributed. Partially calcified areas were also observed by von Kossa stain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,B</xref>). In contrast, bone was frequently observed among muscle fibers in the pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7-treated specimens (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), and the bone contained osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. In addition, calcification was further advanced in these pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7-treated specimens than in the pCAGGS-BMP-2-treated specimens, as revealed by von Kossa stain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D</xref>).

These results suggest that a BMP-2/7 heterodimer forms under these conditions and causes the high ALP activity, indicating that the BMP-2/7 heterodimer has a strong bone-inducing activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, mixing the conditioned media from cells secreting either BMP-2 or BMP-7 alone does not increase the ALP activity synergistically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These systems had three steps: the first was the combined gene transfer of BMP-2 and BMP-7 into epithelial cells to produce BMP-2/7. Next the BMP2/7 protein was purified from the supernatant of these cells. Finally, the purified protein was added to the preosteoblastic or myoblastic cells. Here, we assessed the effect of the direct and simultaneous gene transfer of BMP-2 and BMP-7 into skeletal muscles. Before our <italic>in vivo </italic>study, we carried out an <italic>in vitro </italic>experiment using the mouse myoblastic C2C12 cell line to determine whether cells directly and simultaneously transfected with the BMP-2 and BMP-7 genes would express these genes, as we hoped they would <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the present study, the C2C12 cells showed higher ALP activity in the group receiving the BMP-2 and BMP-7 genes than in the control group or the groups transfected with a single BMP expression plasmid. These results agreed with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Based on our <italic>in vitro </italic>study, we examined whether <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation with equal doses of pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7 is effective for bone formation. Ten days after treatment, direct and simultaneous transfer of the BMP-2 and BMP-7 genes induced higher ALP activity (data not shown), and more intense calcification than did the transfer of either gene alone. In contrast, the calcified areas observed 10 days after the gene transfer with pCAGGS-BMP-2 alone were mostly cartilaginous tissue with very little bone. The muscles transfected with pCAGGS-BMP-7 did not form cartilaginous tissue, bone, or calcified areas during the observation period. Therefore, this study strongly suggests that the direct and simultaneous gene transfer of equal doses of pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7 into skeletal muscles by <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation was successful and resulted in greater osteoinductive activity than the direct transfer of either gene alone. This effect may be owing to the formation of the BMP-2/7 heterodimer as suggested for the <italic>in vitro </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, to fully understand our results, we may need to consider the more complicated and dynamic events underlying osteoinduction <italic>in vivo</italic>, because the extracellular matrix components that bind to BMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and/or the different affinities of the BMPs for their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] must be involved in the osteoinductive activity. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanism of the osteoinduction reported here. For example, a single vector that can express BMP-2 and BMP-7 simultaneously might be useful for assessing the influence of the BMP-2/7 heterodimer on osteoinductive activity <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Endogenous BMP-4 mRNA was highly expressed in the skeletal muscle of rats receiving the pCAGGS-BMP-2 and pCAGGS-BMP-7 genes, but its expression was much weaker in the skeletal muscles of rats receiving only one of the genes. It is reported that BMP-7 down-regulates BMP-4 mRNA through the stages of proliferation, matrix formation, and mineralization in long-term primary cultures of fetal rat calvarial (FRC) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In C2C12 cells, BMP-7 up-regulates the BMP-4 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the other hand, BMP-2 inhibits BMP-4 mRNA expression initially, but stimulates it during the mineralization phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the costochondral growth-plate chondrocytes, BMP-2 induces the expression of BMP-4 mRNA in a cell maturation-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, this is the first report that the simultaneous gene transfer by <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation of BMP-2 and BMP-7 increases the level of BMP-4 mRNA.</p><p>Under conditions of normal osteoblastic cell differentiation, rat BMP-4 mRNA is expressed in the early phase with peak expression levels during the proliferation and matrix formation phases, but it declines afterwards in FRC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic>, a transient elevation in the BMP-4 mRNA levels is reported in osteoprogenitor cells of the periosteum in the early stages of fracture repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, BMP-4 mRNA is detected in areas where fibroblast-like cells and preosteoblasts migrate, in the early stage of distraction osteogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These results seem to suggest that BMP-4 plays an important role in the early phase of osteoinduction. Our histological results at 3 and 5 days, during the early phase of the BMP-4 mRNA increase, revealed abundant migratory spindle-shaped cells, i.e., fibroblast-like cells. These cells were in the same location as those that stained positive for BMP-4 by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the expression of BMP-4 mRNA and its increase in the early phase might be involved with the effective bone formation seen when the BMP-2 and BMP-7 genes were simultaneously transferred into rat skeletal muscles by transcutaneous <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation.</p><p>In this study, we used an animal model to study ectopic bone formation in the skeletal muscles to examine the efficiency of simultaneous and direct BMP-2 and BMP-7 gene transfer using <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation. For clinical applications, it may be possible to reconstruct bone and the accompanying muscle in jaw areas that have been damaged, for example, by trauma or tumour treatment. Moreover, BMP-2 and BMP-7 gene transfer into the periostea to augment the alveolar ridge or fracture repair may enhance periosteal cell differentiation efficiently, because it is well known that periostea have multi-potential stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. If successful, such clinical applications would be very significant and wide-ranging, and could include fracture repair, orthognathic surgery, alveolar ridge augmentation, and dental implants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose that the direct and simultaneous gene transfer of BMP-2 and BMP-7 by <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation is more effective than the transfer of BMP-2 alone, which we explored in an earlier paper using the same conditions, such as the dose of plasmid and the size of the electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Since the major drawbacks of using adenovirus vectors, i.e., the need for titration, the potential toxicity, and the need to suppress the host immune response, are not necessary using this system, gene therapy via <italic>in vivo </italic>electroporation is safer and simpler than via viral vectors. As a methodological consideration, electroporation is quite suitable for the direct and simultaneous transfer of two or more BMP genes for bone regeneration therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MK performed all experiments, analyzed the data, and prepared the manuscript.
