In this respect, the only biochemical marker so far proposed for the selection of the most promising embryo obtained by IVF is represented by the release of in vitro cultured embryo (24-, 48- and 72-hours embryo) of soluble HLA-G (Histocompatibility Leukocyte Antigen-G) molecules. This has been consistently reported by several groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Rebmann1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Yie1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

When the immature oocytes were morphologically classified in metaphase I, germinal vesicle and degenerated phenotypes we observed similar levels of sICAM-1 in the three groups. On the contrary, the mature oocytes subdivided into grade 1, 2 and 3 presented lower s-ICAM-1 levels in grade 1 group. Therefore, these results propose sICAM-1 levels as predictive for oocyte maturation and quality. Biochemical markers of the oocyte maturation are very important, due to the fact that (a) during in vitro oocyte maturation no ore than 50&#x00025; of the oocytes isolated from a single woman reach grade 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003970-t002">Table 2</xref>); (b) only these oocytes are routinely considered for IVF. In addition, we like to point out that in some countries no embryo selection is allowed, only a limited number of oocytes are fertilized and all of the obtained embryos must be implanted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Fineschi1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0003970-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003970.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Details of the in vitro maturation procedure.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0003970-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0003970.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0003970-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Women (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;42)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years) (mean&#x000b1;SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35&#x000b1;3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of recovered oocytes per woman (mean&#x000b1;SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7&#x000b1;1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mature oocytes per woman (&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20&#x02013;50</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The culture supernatants of early embryos showed sICAM-1 levels lower in comparison to both mature and immature oocytes. Interestingly no significant differences were observed in sICAM-1 concentrations in the culture supernatants of early embryos subdivided into grades. These results underline the importance of sICAM-1 as a marker of the oocyte maturation process but not of the early embryos development.</p><p>This is the first report showing release of sICAM-1 in human oocytes and IVF human embryo. However the expression of ICAM-1 in human embryos is not surprising, when considering the implantation phase. In this context, ICAM-1 has been already presented as a protein involved in inflammation. In fact ICAM-1 knock-out mice do not develop inflammation and have less inflammatory cell infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Hallahan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Wang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Mutations of ICAM-1 are associated with different diseases as infarct, biliary atresia, multiple sclerosis, obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Wang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Mousavi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. When the sICAM-1 levels are compared to sHLA-G, a soluble molecule involved in embryo implantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Fuzzi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, sICAM-1 showed higher levels in oocyte supernatants than sHLA-G. These two molecules are both secreted by human oocytes but with a more efficient release of sICAM-1 than of sHLA-G molecules. In general, the release of sHLA-G molecules is very low in most of the oocytes employed. On the contrary, confident results are obtained studying sICAM-1, due to the high release of this protein by human oocytes.</p><p>The results obtained are confirmed using three independent methodologies, such as ELISA, Bio-Plex assay and Western blotting. Therefore, we propose this biochemical marker to be tightly linked to oocyte maturation. This finding is novel and, in our opinion, very important in the field of the selection of oocytes to be fertilized.</p><p>As known, the oocytes obtained under ovarian stimulation present a variable competence and although molecular approaches have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Coticchio1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003970-Patrizio1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, the selection is still performed on morphological characteristics such as ploidy and chromosome/chromatin status. Since maturation of oocytes is so important for in vitro fertilization approaches, we suggest sICAM-1 to be a marker for testing different culture mediums under development by several laboratories to the aim to obtain optimal in vitro oocyte maturation.</p><p>In conclusion, our data encourage further studies from different laboratories/networks using ICAM-1 as a marker for a positive oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Patients</title><p>The oocytes employed in this study were obtained from regularly cycling patients attending the Biogenesi Reproductive Medicine Centre of Monza, Italy, for an Assisted Reproduction Technique with In Vitro Maturation Protocol (IVM).
