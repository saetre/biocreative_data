Due to these diverse enzymatic activities and a demonstrated solvent tolerance, rhodococci have many practical applications for bioconversion and bioremediation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). One hindrance to the full exploitation of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>is the dearth of genetic tools available for strain manipulation. Among the most basic of tools for genetic manipulation of bacteria are plasmids. Plasmids can be used to introduce new or extra copies of genes into bacterial cells and to complement mutations in bacteria. They can be used to manipulate expression levels of different gene products, impacting a variety of cellular processes. Plasmids can also be used to deliver transposable elements or as intermediates in knocking out gene function via homologous recombination. Plasmids also play an important role in horizontal gene transfer among bacteria.</p><p>The lack of plasmid vectors suitable for use in <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>has led several groups to develop binary vectors, in which an extant <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>plasmid is combined with an <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>plasmid forming a new vector that replicates in both cell types. A limited number of shuttle vectors have been developed for <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>based on this principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Working with two environmental isolates of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>(the I24 and B264-1 strains; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) and with the cooperation of other laboratories, we tested a number of the available <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>/<italic>E. coli </italic>shuttle vectors, but we were unable to generate transformants with the majority of these. This and other evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] suggested that the rather narrow host ranges of the currently known shuttle vectors limits their use to only a few <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>species. To overcome this problem we sought to develop a new plasmid vector specifically for working with a variety of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains.</p><p>In this report, we describe a small plasmid, pB264, from <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 that can replicate in diverse <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains. pB264 can be transferred via conjugation from its normal host to other strains of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, and maintenance of pB264 is hindered at temperatures above 35&#x000b0;C. These features make pB264 a valuable tool for genetic manipulation of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>and for studying processes of plasmid maintenance and horizontal gene transfer in this genus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Discovery and cloning of pB264</title><p>In an effort to develop plasmids for genetic manipulation of rhodococci, we examined a number of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains for the presence of small, cryptic plasmids. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA isolated from the B264-1 strain revealed a ca. 5 kb plasmid, which we labeled pB264. Whereas neither <italic>Eco</italic>RI nor <italic>Hin</italic>dIII were able to cut this plasmid, digestion with <italic>Bam</italic>HI produced three bands of ca. 3 kb, 1.5 kb and 0.4 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A sample of the undigested pB264 was isolated from an agarose gel via GeneClean. Isolation of circular DNA by this method produces a small amount of sheared material. We purified the sheared material from a second agarose gel, treated the DNA with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and ligated the products into pCR-Script, producing pAL220. Sequencing of pAL220 revealed an insert of 4970 bp (GenBank accession AY297818). FramePlot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] of the pB264 element revealed several ORFs. The two largest of these were ORF6 (729 nt) and ORF7 (933 nt). BLAST analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] of this sequence revealed that pB264 is nearly identical to pKA22, a plasmid isolated from <italic>R. rhodochrous </italic>NCIMB13064, which was sequenced but not further characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The sole exceptions to this alignment were a thymidine substitution at nt position 17 of pB264 (corresponding to the cytosine residue at nt position 3143 of pKA22) and a thymidine insertion at nt position 37 of pB264 (corresponding to a position between nt 3162 and 3163 of pKA22.) ORFs 6 and 7 of pB264 correspond to ORFs 1 and 2 of pKA22, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>pB264 replicates in other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains</title><p>To test whether pB264 derivatives could be used as gene expression vectors, we sought to determine whether this plasmid could replicate in other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains. Since ampicillin resistance is unsuitable for selection in <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, we introduced additional markers for KanR, TsrR or GntR into pAL220, creating the plasmids pAL224, pAL231 or pAL298, respectively. Electroporation of these plasmids into strains B264-1, I24 or <italic>R. erythropolis </italic>SQ1 produced antibiotic resistant colonies. (Because the I24 strain has a high incidence of spontaneous resistance to kanamycin, pAL224 was not used to test replication in I24.) Unrearranged plasmids could be recovered from these transformants, indicating that each plasmid could replicate autonomously in these strains and that the pB264 element could support replication. The ColE1 replicon of pCR-Script itself does not appear to support replication in <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>as we have never been able to recover antibiotic resistant colonies when ColE1-derived plasmids were used to transform B264-1 or I24, regardless of the selectable marker (see also the deletion analysis of pB264, below). The genetic diversity represented by these three strains among rhodococci (as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]) suggests that pB264 derivatives should be able to replicate in a wide variety of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>isolates.</p></sec><sec><title>Maintenance of pB264 is temperature sensitive</title><p>While <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strain I24 can grow at temperatures above 40&#x000b0;C, the B264-1 strain does not grow significantly above about 32&#x000b0;C (unpublished observations). To test whether replication of pB264 had a similar temperature limitation as its host bacterium, we introduced pAL298 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) into the I24 strain via electroporation. I24(pAL298) was grown in 10 ml LB + gentamicin (10 mg/l) for 2 days at 30&#x000b0;C. 10 &#x003bc;l from this culture were diluted into six separate tubes, each containing 10 ml fresh LB without antibiotics. Three of these cultures were then incubated at 30&#x000b0;C, while the other three were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. After two days, serial dilutions were prepared from each of these cultures and plated onto LB agar or LB agar supplemented with gentamicin. These plates were then incubated for three days at 30&#x000b0;C to determine the proportion of bacteria that had retained the plasmid in each case. Results from these experiments are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. From the cultures that had been grown at 30&#x000b0;C, similar numbers of CFU were recovered on both the LB plates and the LB + gentamicin plates, indicating that pAL298 was well maintained in the I24 strain at 30&#x000b0;C, despite the lack of antibiotic selection. In contrast, from the cultures that had been grown at 37&#x000b0;C, fewer than 0.06% of the CFU retained the antibiotic resistance markers, indicating that replication or maintenance of the plasmid was hindered at the higher temperature. This trend was observed with other derivatives of pB264 as well, regardless of the selectable marker employed (not shown).</p><p>In additional experiments, individuals were recovered from the few antibiotic resistant colonies that arose on the antibiotic plate (incubated at 30&#x000b0;C) from a culture that had been grown at 37&#x000b0;C. Each of these colonies was streaked onto two fresh LB plates supplemented with antibiotics. One plate from each set was incubated at 30&#x000b0;C, while the other was incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for two days. Of the 20 colonies tested in this manner, none grew well at 37&#x000b0;C, while all formed robust colonies at 30&#x000b0;C. This indicates that the few colonies that had retained the plasmids while the cells were growing at 37&#x000b0;C were not the result of mutations that allowed replication at the higher temperature. More likely, these colonies represent the minority of the cells that retained a single copy of the poorly replicating plasmids during cell division at the higher temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Minimal replicon</title><p>To identify the region within pB264 that is responsible for replication in <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, we prepared a series of deletion derivatives of the plasmid pAL298. These deletions are depicted schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The plasmid pAL298 contains the entire pB264 element, the ColEI origin, which does not by itself support replication in <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. strains B264-1 or I24 (not shown), and a GntR marker.</p><p>Dozens of deletion derivatives were prepared from pAL298. These were first propagated in <italic>E. coli </italic>to recover a large amount of purified plasmid. Individual deletion derivatives were then introduced into <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 via electroporation. <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 was used as the host in these experiments, rather than <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 to decrease the possibility that some gene product in the host strain might be supporting plasmid replication <italic>in trans </italic>or via recombination with the native copy of pB264, which might confound the results. Following electroporation, cells were plated onto LB supplemented with gentamicin and incubated for 2&#x02013;3 days at 30&#x000b0;C to identify transformants. Colonies from these plates were inoculated into 10 ml of LB supplemented with gentamicin and grown for 2&#x02013;3 days at 30&#x000b0;C. Total genomic DNA was recovered from each of these and examined for the presence of the intended plasmid either by direct restriction enzyme digest and agarose gel analysis or by the "retransformation" method (see Methods). These tests were necessary to confirm that GntR had not arisen spontaneously nor by recombination of the plasmids into the I24 genome.</p><p>The majority of deletion derivatives tested failed to produce colonies of transformed <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24. Those capable of replicating in the I24 strain are depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Examining the regions retained in plasmids 1&#x02013;8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) strongly suggests a role for the ORF7 and ORF8 gene products in replication of pB264. To test this hypothesis more directly, a 280 bp <italic>Sph</italic>I fragment was deleted from the 5' end of ORF7 (corresponding to the N-terminus of the encoded protein), creating plasmid 9 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We were unable to obtain transformed colonies when electroporating plasmid 9 into <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24, even though parallel electroporations of plasmid 8 were always successful. These results suggested that plasmid 9 had lost the ability to replicate autonomously in <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. In contrast, when the gene product of ORF7 was supplied <italic>in trans</italic>, plasmid 9 could replicate in the I24 strain. This was accomplished by preparing plasmid 13 (pAL312), which can replicate in <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 because of the NG2 origin it possesses. ORF7 is positioned downstream of a constitutive promoter in this plasmid. pAL312 was introduced into the I24 strain, and competent cells were prepared from the transformant. Subsequently, plasmid 9 was introduced into I24(pAL312) by electroporation. Recovery of both plasmid 9 and pAL312 from the resulting transformants confirmed that each was replicating separately and that plasmid 9 was not being supported because of some recombination event. In contrast, plasmid 12, which expresses a truncated version of ORF7, was unable to support replication of plasmid 9, further confirming the role of the ORF7 gene product. In a similar series of experiments the region carrying ORF8 was deleted from either plasmid 8 or plasmid 6, creating plasmids 10 and 11, respectively. Neither of these plasmids produced colonies when electroporated into <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24, unless that host was already carrying pAL314, which expresses both ORF7 and ORF8. Replication of plasmids 10 and 11 could not be complemented <italic>in trans </italic>by pAL312, indicating that ORF8 is required for replication. These results also indicate that all of the <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements required for plasmid maintenance (such as <italic>oriV</italic>) reside within the portions of pB264 that were retained in both plasmid 9 and plasmid 11, most likely within the 139 bp region that was retained immediately upstream of ORF7. While it seems likely that other elements may reside on pB264, such as copy number control elements, partitioning functions or plasmid addiction systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we found that the smallest deletion derivative of pAL298 (plasmid 8, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) was maintained as stably as pAL298 (if not more so) by <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 cells in both the presence and the absence of antibiotic selection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>pB264 can be mobilized via bacterial conjugation</title><p>PFGE analysis of the <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 revealed the presence of at least two megaplasmids in the 250&#x02013;300 kb size range (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Megaplasmids have often been implicated in conjugal transfer of DNAs between bacterial cells. In many cases, these large extrachromosomal elements have been found to encode the functions (especially the <italic>trans </italic>acting components) necessary to physically conduct the DNA from the donor to the recipient cell. The presence of such elements in the B264-1 strain suggests the possibility that this strain can promote conjugal transfer of DNAs between cells. In other systems, small plasmids have been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] or created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]) that can also be transferred conjugally, though these small elements do not themselves encode the full complement of <italic>trans</italic>-acting functions required for transfer.</p><p>To test whether the plasmid pB264 could be mobilized from <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 into other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains, we constructed the plasmid pXS9a, which carries the entire pB264 element, an <italic>E. coli </italic>origin of replication, and three selectable markers (KanR and TsrR for selection in <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, and AmpR for selection in <italic>E. coli</italic>). This plasmid was introduced into the B264-1 strain via electroporation, and the presence of the unrearranged plasmid confirmed. (Examining plasmid DNA from these transformants revealed that establishment of pXS9a was accompanied by the loss of the native pB264, suggesting incompatibility of the two plasmids.) B264-1 (as a negative control) or B264-1(pXS9a) were then co-cultivated with prospective recipient strains as described in Methods. Following co-incubation, the cell mixtures were transferred to selective plates containing rifampicin (to select against the donor strain) and thiostrepton and kanamycin (to select for the plasmid) and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C. When <italic>R. erythropolis </italic>SQ1 or <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 R6 were used as recipients in these experiments, RifR, TsrR and KanR colonies were recovered that could easily be distinguished from the donor strain based on colony color and morphology. When plasmid DNA was isolated from these putative transconjugants, each was found to carry pXS9a, unrearranged (data not shown). Transconjugants were also recovered when B264-1 R1 was used as a recipient strain. In contrast, no RifR, TsrR and KanR colonies were recovered in these experiments when recipient cultures were co-incubated with untransformed donors (B264-1), heat-treated donors [B264-1(pXS9a) incubated at 65&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes], filtered supernatants from B264-1(pXS9a) cultures, or naked pXS9a plasmid DNA. These results indicate that the pB264 derivative pXS9a can be transferred conjugally from <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 to other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains. We have used conjugation to successfully transfer other pB264 derivatives from <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 to a variety of other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains, including an environmental isolate of <italic>R. erythropolis </italic>that is distinct from the SQ1 strain, and three other environmental isolates of <italic>R. ruber</italic>, <italic>R, rhodochrous </italic>and <italic>R. fasciens</italic>.</p><p>Given that the <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. I24 strain can grow at higher temperatures than can the B264-1 donor strain, we sought to exploit temperature as a selective agent in such conjugation experiments. To accomplish this, we first needed a version of the pB264 plasmid that could replicate stably at the elevated temperature. Rather than identifying a mutant pB264 with this property, we chose to simply add a second, temperature stable origin of replication to the pB264 element, creating the plasmid pJANET (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>; the NG2 origin from <italic>Corynebacterium diphtheriae </italic>replicates in both <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and is stable at 37&#x000b0;C). We found that growth at 37&#x000b0;C (in conjunction with gentamicin) is very effective for selecting transconjugants when the donor is B264-1(pJANET) and the recipients are the I24 strain or other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains that grow at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To estimate the efficiency of transfer, conjugations were carried out between B264-1(pJANET) and the I24 strain. Following co-incubation of the donor and recipient strain (prior to the selection step), serial dilutions were prepared from the cell mixture. Portions from these dilutions were plated onto either LB agar or LB agar supplemented with gentamicin, and these plates were treated in three different ways (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). (1) Incubating the LB gentamicin plates at 37&#x000b0;C, conditions that only permit growth of I24(pJANET), we were able to identify the total number of transconjugants per experiment. (2) Incubating the LB gentamicin plates at 30&#x000b0;C, we were able to calculate the total number of donor cells [B264-1(pJANET)] used in each experiment. Under these conditions, both donors and transconjugants would be able to grow. However, the transconjugants have an easily distinguishable phenotype (color) and the total number of donors greatly exceed the total number of transconjugants, so it was a simple matter to determine which colonies were derived from donor or recipient cells. (3) From LB plates (no antibiotic) grown at 37&#x000b0;C, we were able to determine the total number of recipient cells used in the experiment. Under these conditions, no donors can grow, but all recipients can grow, regardless of whether they have acquired the antibiotic resistance marker. From six replicates of this experiment, representing 2 sets of donor and recipient cultures, three independent matings each, and then serial dilutions prepared from each of these matings, we calculated that 1 transconjugant was generated per 1.11 &#x000b1; 0.28 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>donors. This corresponds to 1 transconjugant per 1.37 &#x000b1; 0.36 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>recipients.</p></sec><sec><title>Origin of transfer</title><p><italic>Trans</italic>-acting elements are likely to play an important role in the conjugal transfer of the plasmid from B264-1 to other <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains. Given the size of pB264 and the presence of megaplasmids in the B264-1 strain, it is entirely possible that none of the required trans-acting factors are encoded by pB264. However, it is almost certain that a specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting element (an origin of transfer or <italic>oriT</italic>) resides on pB264. To determine what portion of pB264 enables conjugal transfer <italic>in cis</italic>, we prepared a series of deletions in pJANET and tested each for the ability to be transferred in conjugations between the B264-1 donor and an I24 recipient (using growth at 37&#x000b0;C and gentamicin for selection of transconjugants). We were unable to recover transconjugants with the majority of deletion derivatives tested in this manner, including pAL281, which is related to pJANET but lacks the entire pB264 element. B264-1 donors carrying the plasmids pJANET X&#x00394;27 (plasmid 17 of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), pJANET XS (plasmid 18), pJANET XB (plasmid 19), or pAL315 (plasmid 20) produced transconjugants at frequencies similar to B264-1(pJANET). In all cases, transconjugants were tested further and found to have taken up the unaltered test plasmids (not shown). Sequences in common between the smallest of these plasmids, pJANET XS and pAL315, correspond to a region of 743 bp from pB264 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) that is apparently devoid of ORFs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The complete nucleotide sequence of the small, cryptic plasmid pB264 (4970 bp) of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 was determined. The G+C content of the sequence of this plasmid is 64.8 mol%. pB264 proved to be identical to the largely uncharacterized cryptic plasmid pKA22 isolated from <italic>R. rhodochrous </italic>NCIMB13064 by Kulakov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The translational product of ORF7 (corresponding to ORF2 of Kulakov et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) consists of 296 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 33 KDa, whereas the 82 amino acid translation product of ORF8 has a predicted mass of approximately 9.2 KDa. BLAST analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] of ORF7 and ORF8 identified several additional database entries with greater than 50% of amino acid identity to the predicted gene product (not shown). These include the two components of a putative theta replicase (<italic>repA</italic>, encoding a putative primase, and <italic>repB</italic>, encoding a putative DNA binding protein) from <italic>Brevibacterium linens </italic>plasmid pLIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], as well as putative proteins encoded by the <italic>Mycobacterium fortuitum </italic>plasmid pAL5000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and relatives of this plasmid. These homologies suggest that the pB264 replicon belongs to the pAL5000 family of Gram-positive theta replicating plasmids, a group that includes plasmids that have been isolated from <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, <italic>Brevibacterium</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the deduced amino acid sequence of ORF7 contains the characteristic helix-turn-helix motif of DNA binding proteins (data not shown). The presence of two major motifs within the RepA protein of pB264 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] that are characteristic of theta replicating plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] provides additional evidence that pB264 uses a theta mode of replication. Our deletion analysis of pB264 provides strong evidence that ORF7 and ORF8 are required for plasmid replication, supporting the designation of these ORFs as <italic>repA </italic>and <italic>repB</italic>. Further supporting this assertion is the observation that expression of <italic>repA </italic>and <italic>repB in trans </italic>supports replication of pB264 derivatives that lack either or both of these elements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The RepA and RepB proteins of other plasmids from the pAL5000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and ColE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] families have also been shown to function <italic>in trans</italic>.</p><p>The majority of small plasmids isolated from Gram-positive organisms are believed to replicate <italic>via </italic>a rolling circle mechanism, where the leading DNA strand is first synthesized from a starting <italic>nic </italic>site and then used as a template for production of the lagging strand. Unfortunately, many vectors based on RC origins of replication exhibit structural and/or segregational instability that is not observed in plasmids that employ a theta mode of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This instability appears to be exacerbated by the insertion of foreign DNA fragments. The observed instability of RC plasmids has been attributed to formation of single stranded DNA intermediates, which may result in deletions due to illegitimate recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Additionally, it has been proposed that the formation of high molecular mass multimers provides a selection against recombinant plasmids, thereby also encouraging the enrichment of deletion derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The segregational instability of RC based plasmids containing cloned DNA sequences has similarly been attributed to this selection disadvantage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>has proven particularly refractile to gene cloning using such RC based vectors. By exploiting the theta-mode replication functions of pB264, shuttle vectors constructed will avoid the segregational and structural instability problems inherent to RC replicons. Our experience with pB264 derivatives supports this assertion.</p><p>The observation that replication or maintenance of pB264 is affected by the temperature at which the host cell is grown is reminiscent of the plasmid pSG5. Muth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] discovered pSG5, a rolling circle type plasmid, in an isolate of <italic>Streptomyces ghanaensis</italic>. This isolate had a limited tolerance for elevated temperatures and could not grow above 35&#x000b0;C. While pSG5 derivatives could replicate in other <italic>Streptomyces </italic>isolates, it could do so only at lower temperatures (&#x02264; 34&#x000b0;C). Even though some of these strains could grow above 35&#x000b0;C they could not retain the plasmid at this higher temperature. In the present experiments, the <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>sp. B264-1 strain cannot grow at 37&#x000b0;C while the I24 strain can. Although pB264 could replicate in both strains, it was rapidly lost from the I24 strain when that host was grown at 37&#x000b0;C (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Three classes of theta replicating plasmids, designated A, B, and C, have been defined in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These classes differ with respect to their structural features and are based almost exclusively on studies of Gram-negative bacteria. Theta replicating plasmids from Gram-positive bacteria have not yet been extensively studied, but most appear to fall into one of the first two classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Gram-positive theta replicons, such as pAM&#x003b2;1, have been identified that do not appear to fit into these established classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Similarly, pB264 does not appear to fit easily into these theta classifications. The basic replicon of pB264 encodes RepA and RepB proteins essential for replication and does not appear to carry an <italic>oriA</italic>-like structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], which sets pB264 apart from the previously described Rep-dependent class A plasmids. Similarly, several features distinguish pB264 and class B replication. First, class B replicons do not encode Rep proteins, whereas pB264 does. Second, there is no homology between the pB264 replicon and the highly conserved <italic>ca</italic>. 600 nt elements that are characteristic of class B plasmids. Third, pB264 can replicate in at least three diverse species of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>, while class B plasmids characteristically have a narrow host range. The pAL5000 family of replicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and specifically pB264, superficially resemble class C replicons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], consisting almost entirely of the <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived ColE2 and ColE3 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). Class C plasmids encode Rep proteins and do not require an <italic>oriA</italic>-like structure for replication. However, the homology between the replication regions of pB264 (or other pAL5000-type plasmids) and the class C plasmids is, at best, highly diverged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no significant homology between the Rep proteins of the pAL5000-type plasmids and ColE2. We, therefore, believe that pB264, and by extension the pAL5000 family of replicons, belongs to a separate class of theta replicating plasmids. Further work is required to determine how widespread this class is and what its relation is (if any) to the previously described class C replicons.</p><p>While replication functions in pAL5000 have been extensively studied, our results with pB264 suggest that this plasmid is part of a distinct sub-group. Experimental evidence has shown replication of pAL5000 to be dependent on several sequence domains immediately upstream of the <italic>repAB </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The "L-site" is a low affinity Rep binding site where replication initiates. The "H-site" contains GC-rich and AT-rich 8 bp palindromes, as well as two short, inverted repeats. Mutations within these structures interfered with binding of RepB as well as replication. pB264 contains no structures that resemble either the L-site or the H-site. However, pB264 does possess two AT-enriched domains, comprising DR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Within this domain is a sequence that is highly conserved among pAL5000 and its relatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although it has not been shown directly that the conserved element is required for replication of pAL5000. The smallest autonomously replicating derivative of pB264 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) retains only one of the two repeat elements within DR2. Chattoraj [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] described a scenario in which two components of a direct repeat enabled copy number control, whereas only one copy was required for plasmid replication.</p><p>Bacterial conjugation is a specialized gene transfer process that involves unidirectional transfer of DNA from donor to recipient bacteria by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. Plasmids spread both within and between bacterial species primarily through conjugal transfer. Plasmids are classified according to their conjugative ability as conjugative (auto-transmissible), mobilizable (transmissible only in the presence of a helper conjugative plasmid), or non-mobilizable. Conjugative plasmids contain the necessary genetic information to catalyze conjugative DNA processing and DNA transport. Mobilizable plasmids lack part of this machinery. Naturally occurring mobilizable plasmids contain <italic>oriT</italic>, the only DNA sequence required in <italic>cis </italic>for conjugation, and they may encode a set of proteins to process <italic>oriT </italic>and make it available to the transport complex.</p><p>Plasmid pB264 and genetically labeled derivatives could be transferred to different <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>strains by conjugation, showing that pB264 is a mobilizable plasmid. Experiments with filtered culture supernatants, heat-treated donor cultures and naked DNA distinguished conjugal transfer from other possible modes of DNA transfer such as phage-mediated or direct DNA uptake. A region involved in mobilization of pB264 was identified that is distinct from the regions involved in replication. This region includes both inverted repeats (IR8) and direct repeats (DR1) that may serve as the <italic>oriT </italic>sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Others have proposed that such repeat elements play a role in conjugal plasmid transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Currently, pB264 remains cryptic as no function, other than replication and mobilization functions, has been attributed to this plasmid. None of the predicted open reading frames, other than the designated <italic>repA </italic>and <italic>repB</italic>, show significant homology to any functionally defined sequence. In <italic>R. rhodochrous </italic>NCIMB13064, the pB264 homolog, pKA22, appeared to segregate with the loss of the ability to utilize short chain 1-chloroalkanes and the appearance of a naphthalene degrading phenotype, in that reversion to wild type phenotype appeared to correlate with disappearance of the cryptic plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This association, however, is more likely attributed to the effects of plasmid integration into the chromosome rather than an explicit, plasmid encoded function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The plasmid pB264 has several properties that make it useful for genetic manipulation of rhodococci. First, it replicates in diverse <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>hosts. Second, it can be easily transferred via conjugation from the B264-1 host to other strains. This property becomes especially valuable when working with strains of <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>that are not amenable to direct transformation (e.g. via electroporation). Third, pB264 is temperature sensitive. Combining the conjugability of the plasmid with its temperature sensitivity, pB264 can be employed as a suicide vector for introducing elements such as transposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] into the chromosome of recipient strains. We have exploited these properties to create several gene knockouts via homologous recombination in <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>(manuscript in preparation). While the conjugability of pB264 is useful in the above applications, this plasmid also provides an important resource for studying the processes of plasmid replication and horizontal gene transfer among <italic>Rhodococcus </italic>spp.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>General DNA manipulation</title><p>Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and molecular weight markers were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used as specified by the manufacturer.
