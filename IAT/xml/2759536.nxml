Here, we demonstrate that in the mouse mammary gland, loss of one Syk allele profoundly increases proliferation and ductal branching and invasion of epithelial cells through the mammary fat pad during puberty. Mammary carcinomas develop by one year. Syk also suppresses proliferation and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>. siRNA or shRNA knockdown of Syk in MCF10A breast epithelial cells dramatically increased proliferation, anchorage independent growth, cellular motility, and invasion, with formation of functional, extracellular matrix-degrading invadopodia. Morphological and gene microarray analysis following Syk knockdown revealed a loss of luminal and differentiated epithelial features with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and a gain in invadopodial cell surface markers CD44, CD49F, and MMP14. These results support the role of Syk in limiting proliferation and invasion of epithelial cells during normal morphogenesis, and emphasize the critical role of Syk as a tumor suppressor for breast cancer. The question of breast cancer risk following systemic anti-Syk therapy is raised since only partial loss of Syk was sufficient to induce mammary carcinomas.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the normal function of Syk in the developing and adult breast, its upstream activators and downstream effectors, and epigenetic and genetic factors that cause its loss are vital for breast cancer prognosis, prediction and treatment.

However, the normal function of Syk in mammary epithelium has not been addressed, nor have experiments been performed to determine the consequences of Syk loss from normal epithelial cells. MCF10A immortalized breast epithelial cells and cells derived from them serve as an <italic>in vitro</italic> model system to understand normal epithelial function and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Debnath1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Krause1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

MCF10A are Syk positive, but the Syk status or functionality in this progression series is not known. The mouse mammary gland is another system to model normal epithelial behavior. The branching network of epithelial ducts arises from the combination of proliferation and epithelial ductal invasion through the fat pad via the formation of terminal end buds (TEB), TEB bifurcation and lateral branching, and ductal elongation. Unfortunately, nothing is known concerning Syk function in the adult or developing breast.

Strikingly, knockdown of Syk using either siRNA or shRNA consistently enhanced proliferation, motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in each of these cell lines along the progression series to DCIS.com, a cell line modeling ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Thus, changes in levels of Syk potently mediate their effects on these activities and suggest that Syk must be present in epithelial cells at all stages of progression including benign tissues in order to suppress invasive, tumor-like cell behavior. The results in human breast epithelial cells are supported by the results in the mouse mammary gland where loss of one allele had an impressive effect on mammary ductal structure and ultimately on carcinoma development. In both human and mouse epithelial cells, we demonstrated increased cellular proliferation and invasion. The mouse heterozygote model further demonstrates that partial systemic loss of Syk can result in hyperplastic growth, tumor formation, and in some cases metastasis. The results on Syk knockdown in MCF10A cells support the interpretation that Syk is required in the epithelial cells of normal mouse mammary glands to control proper growth and invasion during puberty although it is possible that additional factors contribute since Syk is present in other tissues including immune cells and endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Coopman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that loss of Syk triggers EMT.

Interestingly, although vimentin expression in cell lines is correlated with their invasive capacity, vimentin filament expression was not correlated with invadopodia formation and degradation in individual cells. This is consistent with the report that although vimentin is associated with early sites of formation of podosomes in smooth muscle and osteoclasts, it does not seem to be directly involved in podosome formation and vimentin does not localize at the puncta of actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Akisaka1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Gad1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, Syk potentially regulates at least three major signaling pathways to suppress proliferation and invasion. These pathways have important functions in the development and maintenance of the normal mammary gland and their disruption gives rise to EMT, invadopodia formation, and cancer progression. Consequently, the significance of the overlap between invadopodia-related proteins and cell surface stem cell markers (CD44 and CD49F) is not known but is highly suggestive of the involvement of invadopodia cell surface proteins in stem/progenitor cell function during development.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that the presence of wild type levels of Syk in normal breast epithelial cells is critical to suppress proliferation and invasion, and that partial loss promotes hyperplasia and the eventual formation of mammary tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. The significance of oral or locally applied Syk inhibitors for breast cancer risk is of critical concern in the context of the current development of agents targeting Syk for therapeutic treatment of allergy, asthma and autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Zhu1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Masuda1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the Georgetown University Care and Use of Animals Committee (GUGUAC, protocol no. 07&#x02013;020) and by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC).</p><p>Syk heterozygous (&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) 129 background mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007445-Turner2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> were crossed with homozygous eGFP <sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) transgenic FVB mice and the progeny genotyped for Syk. eGFP mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine).

Hybridization, washing, and imaging steps were performed in the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center Macromolecular Shared Resource.
