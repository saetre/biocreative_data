If not repaired or improperly repaired, DSBs would lead to chromosome deletions and translocations, causing premature cell death or oncogenic transformation. In eukaryotes, three major pathways have been identified to repair DSBs: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR) and single-strand annealing (SSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). In NHEJ, DNA ends are ligated either directly (for compatible or blunt ends) or after some limited fill-in/degradation (for incompatible ends). In HR, DNA ends are processed into extensive 3&#x02032; single-stranded (ss-) tails, which then invade a homologous sequence to copy the missing information. SSA is often used to repair a break that occurs between two direct repeats, which are common in the genome of higher eukaryotes. DNA ends are also processed into 3&#x02032; ss-tails, but the two tails on each side of the break anneal with each other, leading effectively to the deletion of one of the two repeats and the intervening sequence.</p><p>The first step of HR and SSA is the processing of DSBs into 3&#x02032; ss-tails. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the RecC nuclease in the RecBCD complex is a major nuclease for degrading the 5&#x02032; strand after the ends are unwound by the RecB and the RecD helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, the RecJ 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease has been proposed to degrade the 5&#x02032; strand following end unwinding mediated by RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In eukaryotes, the nuclease responsible for the strand-specific degradation of DNA ends has yet to be definitively identified. Genetic analyses in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> suggest that the MRE11-RAD50-XRS2 (MRX) complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 or MRN in higher eukaryotes) plays an important role in end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). MRE11 has both an exonuclease and an endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10">7&#x02013;10</xref>), but the directionality of the exonuclease activity is 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; rather than 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032;. Furthermore, a nuclease-inactivating mutant that can still form the MRX complex shows no significant defect in end processing, whereas other mutations that block end processing appear to do so by destabilizing the MRX complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). Mre11 interacts with Sae2 (Ctp1 in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and CtIP in higher eukaryotes), and disruption of Sae2/CtIP blocks end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). Sae2 has an endonuclease activity on DNA structures like hairpins, but how this activity contributes to the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Another candidate nuclease is EXO1, which, when overexpressed, can suppress the mitotic DNA repair defect of <italic>mre11</italic>, <italic>rad50</italic> and <italic>xrs2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). While EXOI has a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity, an <italic>exoI</italic> null mutant has no significant defect in recombinational repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and only minor defect in DNA end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Therefore, if EXOI is directly involved in end processing, it must do so in redundancy with other 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleases.</p><p>We have used the <italic>Xenopus</italic> nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) as the model system to study DSB repair and end processing. We found that this system can efficiently reconstitute both NHEJ and SSA. This allowed us to show by immunodepletion that the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Werner syndrome protein (xWRN) plays an important role in SSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Further analysis of xWRN's role in SSA led to the elucidation of a mechanism for the 5&#x02032; strand-specific processing of DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). End processing in NPE consists of two steps: first the end is unwound and then the 5&#x02032; ss-tail is specifically degraded, resulting in the 3&#x02032; ss-tail as the final product. This mechanism is remarkably similar to the model that has been proposed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ helicase and the RecJ 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease. While xWRN is one of the eukaryotic homologs of RecQ, database search did not reveal the existence of an eukaryotic homolog of RecJ. We thus used biochemical methods to purify and identify the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts. In this study, we show that DNA2 (xDNA2) is one of the major 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleases in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts. We also show that depletion of xDNA2 from NPE results in a significant reduction in DNA end processing and this defect can be complemented by the purified xDNA2 protein. Corresponding to the defect in end processing, the efficiency of the SSA repair pathway is reduced. Together, these results provide stsrong evidence that xDNA2 is a major nuclease for the strand-specific processing of DNA ends and the subsequent homology-dependent DSB repair.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Extract preparation</title><p>Crude extracts, membrane-free cytosol and nucleoplasmic extracts were prepared from unfertilized <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs following the standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclease purification</title><p>Approximately 10 ml membrane-free cytosol was diluted with equal volume of buffer ELB [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)] and then fractionated by ammonium sulfate at 37.5&#x02013;50% saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

While xWRN is one of the eukaryotic homologs of RecQ, our database search did not reveal the existence of an eukaryotic homolog of RecJ. We thus used biochemical methods to purify and identify the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract contains efficient 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ss-exonuclease activity but no significant 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; ss-exonuclease activity or endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). By biochemical fractionation, the major 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease activity could be separated into two fractions, one with a low level of nuclease activity and one with a stimulating factor, by heparin column. The nuclease assay used a 48-mer ss-oligonucleotide with two <sup>32</sup>P dA and a biotinylated dC at the 3&#x02032;-end as the substrate. After binding to Streptavidin magnetic beads, the 3&#x02032; end was blocked but the 5&#x02032; end accessible. The 250 mM NaCl elute, but not the flow through, contained a low nuclease activity. When the two fractions were combined, the nuclease activity was greatly stimulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The nuclease fraction was further purified by hydroxyappatite and gel filtration. For the final step of purification, the active fraction from the gel filtration column was incubated with 5&#x02032; ss-oligonucleotides (unlabeled) attached to magnetic beads. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, a major band of &#x0223c;120 kD could efficiently bind to DNA beads and then be eluted with a buffer containing 1 M NaCl. Correspondingly, the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonuclease activity was depleted from the DNA bead-treated supernatant but recovered in the elute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;3). These data strongly suggested that the 120 kD protein was responsible for the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA nuclease activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of this protein excised from an SDS&#x02013;PAGE identified it as the <italic>Xenopus</italic> homolog of the budding yeast DNA2 (xDNA2). (The faint band just below was a partial degradation product of xDNA2.) Consistent with this identification, the sequence of xDNA2 contains a RecC-type nuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Purification and identification of the major 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts.

As expected, this xRPA could be removed by incubation with 5&#x02032; ss-oligonucleotide beads. Concomitantly, the stimulating activity was also removed after incubation with ssDNA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). Most importantly, the purified xRPA could equally stimulate the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ss-exonuclease activity of the purified xDNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lanes 3 and 4). 30 nM and 90 nM xRPA showed similar stimulatory activity, while xRPA by itself showed barely detectable degradation even at 90 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 6).

The anti-xDNA2 antibodies were purified and then used to deplete xDNA2 from NPE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, xDNA2 could be removed to a level below detection (&#x0003e;98% depletion). The substrate for DNA end processing was a linear pUC19 DNA that had been labeled with <sup>32</sup>P-dATP at the 3&#x02032;-end by Klenow. NPE can efficiently process this DNA in the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; direction if NHEJ pathway is blocked by ddNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In mock-depleted NPE, the DNA was rapidly processed, as detected by both SYBR Gold DNA staining and the <sup>32</sup>P label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). In contrast, in xDNA2-depleted NPE, end processing was greatly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, &#x02212;xDNA2 NPE). Even after 120 min of incubation, there was still a significant amount of partially processed DNA left in xDNA2-depleted NPE. The remaining end processing was probably due to a combination of the residual xDNA2 and the presence of a functionally redundant nuclease. The xDNA2 depletion effect was specific because it could largely be reversed by the addition of the purified xDNA2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, compare the 120&#x02032; time points of the &#x02212;xDNA2 NPE + xDNA2 or buffer).

End processing proceeds in at least two steps: unwinding of the dsDNA end and the degradation of the 5&#x02032; ss-tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). As a 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease activity, xDNA2 was expected to catalyze the 5&#x02032; ssDNA degradation. This hypothesis was tested by incubating heat-denatured linear ss-pUC19 DNA in xDNA2-depleted or mock-depleted NPE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, while the ssDNA was rapidly degraded in mock-depleted NPE, it was much more stable in xDNA2-depleted NPE. This effect was specific because when the purified xDNA2 protein (no RPA) was added back to the reaction, the ss-pUC19 DNA was again degraded. [The kinetics was slightly slower than in mock-depleted NPE due to the limited amount of xDNA2 added back (&#x0223c;5% of the endogenous xDNA2).] These results show that xDNA2 is indeed important for ss-tail degradation. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of xDNA2 on 5&#x02032; ss-tail degradation.

While <italic>Xenopus</italic> DNA2 displays no helicase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, this might be similar to the exonuclease activity in that a stimulatory factor for the helicase activity is missing. We thus examined the potential effect of xDNA2 on DNA end unwinding. The substrate for the unwinding assay was a 48 bp oligonuleotide duplex, with one strand carrying a biotin moiety at its 5&#x02032;-end and the complementary strand carrying 24 normal nucleotides in the 5&#x02032; half followed by 21 thionucleotides (resistant to nuclease digestion) in the 3&#x02032; half and <sup>32</sup>P-dA near the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The oligonucleotide duplex was first bound onto Streptavidin magnetic beads and then incubated with xDNA2-depleted or mock-depleted NPE. End processing could only proceed from the 5&#x02032;-end of the thio-strand and then stall at thionucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Without unwinding, the partially degraded thio-strand would have remained annealed to the biotin strand and thus bound to the beads. With unwinding, in contrast, it would have been released from the beads. In mock-depleted NPE, the partially degraded thio-strand was as expected unwound and released into the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In xDNA2-depleted NPE, the thio-strand was also efficiently released into the supernatant, suggesting that xDNA2 depletion did not affect unwinding. Notably, the released oligo migrated much slower than the oligo released in mock-depleted NPE. This again showed that in the absence of xDNA2, the unwound ssDNA was not efficiently degraded. Together, these data indicated that xDNA2 is not required for the unwinding of dsDNA ends. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of xDNA2 on end unwinding.

While the above data showed that xDNA2 plays an important role in DNA end processing, it is unclear if this function contributes to DSB repair or is merely for degrading DNA. To address this question, we determined the effect of xDNA2 depletion on SSA, which could be efficiently reconstituted in NPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The substrate for SSA was a 5.6 kb linear DNA with two 1.2 kb direct repeats at the ends. SSA in NPE occurs preferentially intermolecularly, resulting in dimers with only one repeat (as opposed to two repeats by NHEJ) retained at the junction. NHEJ is also active and produces circular monomers (both supercoiled and relaxed) and dimers. Multimers composed of more than two molecules are also produced after longer incubation by continued intermolecular repair. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, depletion of xDNA2 caused a dramatic reduction in the formation of SSA repair products. This effect was specific as it could be complemented to a significant extent by the addition of the purified xDNA2 protein (to &#x0223c;5% of the endogenous level). For NHEJ products, there was no reduction but a slight increase in dimer formation, presumably because more DNA molecules were channeled to this pathway. (The circular monomers migrated mostly as the relaxed form in xDNA-depleted NPE, but this effect was not reproducible.) Together, these data demonstrate that the xDNA2-mediated end processing is coupled to the downstream homology-dependent DSB repair pathway. <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Effect of xDNA2 on SSA.

The end is first unwound by a helicase, mainly xWRN in NPE, into 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ssDNA tails in an ATP-dependent reaction. An unknown 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease(s) then degrades the 5&#x02032; ss-tail in an ATP-independent reaction. The lack of significant 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; ss- exonuclease activity in NPE ensures that the 3&#x02032; ss-tail remains as the final processing product. This mechanism is remarkably similar to the model that has been proposed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ/RecJ proteins except that the exonuclease corresponding to RecJ is unknown. In this study, we purified and identified xDNA2 as one of the major 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonucleases in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. In a previous study, recombinant xDNA2 displayed only a very low level of ssDNA exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). However, the difference between the two studies is superficial because, as shown in this study, the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; ssDNA exonuclease activity is greatly stimulated by RPA, which was not used in the previous study. The role of xDNA2 in end processing was confirmed by the immunodepletion experiments showing that in the absence of xDNA2, end processing was significantly inhibited. In addition, depletion of xDNA2 caused a dramatic inhibition of SSA. Both defects could be complemented by the purified xDNA2 protein. Mechanistically, xDNA affects specifically the degradation of the 5&#x02032; ss-tail but not the unwinding of the DNA end. Functionally, the xDNA2-mediated end processing is not merely for degrading DNA but rather coupled to homology-dependent DSB repair. Taken together, these results indicate that, despite the lack of significant sequence homology between xDNA2 and RecJ, xDNA2 serves a function equivalent to what has been postulated for the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecJ exonuclease in end processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model for the strand-specific processing of DNA ends. (<bold>A</bold>) End processing in the nucleoplasmic extract. xWRN (and potentially other helicases) are recruited to unwind the end in an ATP-dependent reaction. xDNA2 (and another exonuclease(s)) degrades the 5&#x02032; ss-tail.

It appears to participate in Okazaki fragment maturation, telomere maintenance and DNA DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). There is strong evidence that DNA2 and RecQ helicases interact functionally. A double mutant of DNA2 and SGS1, the yeast RecQ-type helicase, is conditionally lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Human WRN and BLM are both able to complement the yeast DNA2 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). There is also evidence that DNA2 might be involved in end processing. A double mutant of DNA2 and EXO1, which by itself has a certain albeit minor effect on end processing, is lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In addition, in the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic>, DNA2 affects the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; resection of telomeres, which are essentially natural DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Interestingly, the intermediates in end processing and Okazaki fragment maturation are both branched molecules and in both cases it is the 5&#x02032; ss-branch that is cleaved. Previous studies have suggested that DNA2 is the nuclease that cleaves long 5&#x02032; branches sometimes generated during Okazaki fragment maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Notably, in this capacity, DNA2 does not act as a classical flap endonuclease like FEN1 to cleave at the branch point but rather as an exonuclease to shorten the 5&#x02032; branch. This role for DNA2 is essentially the same as that in end processing. In light of these observations, we conclude that our finding that xDNA2 is important for DNA end processing in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system is consistent with genetic studies in yeast and the known mechanistic role of DNA2.</p><p>In summary, our biochemical studies in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> system have suggested that xWRN and xDNA2 work in sequence to execute the strand-specific end processing by acting respectively in end unwinding and 5&#x02032; ss-tail degradation. While these two proteins appear to constitute the basic mechanical components, they cannot be the only proteins for end processing. Depletion of neither xWNR nor xDNA2 led to a complete block to end processing, suggesting that there might exist other helicases and nucleases that could perform similar functions. In addition, WRN requires a 3&#x02032; ss-tail to initiate unwinding, but natural DSBs are expected to be blunt ended or nearly blunt ended. This suggests that there might be other proteins to load WRN to DSBs. One tantalizing possibility is that the MRN complex, which can rapidly bind to DSB ends, and Sae2/CtIP, which interacts with MRN, might serve such a role in the early stage of end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Potentially, MRN, in concert with other proteins like Sae2/CtIP, might recruit WRN to DNA ends by direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction or by partially unwinding ends to provide the landing pad for WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The <italic>Xenopus</italic> system should provide an excellent opportunity for the elucidation of the mechanistic roles of these proteins and for the identification of additional proteins for end processing.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p><grant-sponsor>National Institute of Health</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>R01 GM57962-02</grant-num>); Pennsylvania Department of Health (Tobacco Formula Grant 69133-01 to H.
