We identified endogenous CCK2R expression in several cell lines and used luciferase promoter&#x02013;reporter constructs to define the minimal promoter required for transcription in human gastric adenocarcinoma, AGS, and rat gastric mucosa, RGM1, cells. Consensus binding sites for SP1, C/EBP and GATA were essential for activity. Following serum withdrawal from RGM1 and AR42J cells, endogenous CCK2R mRNA abundance and the activity of a CCK2R promoter&#x02013;reporter construct were significantly elevated. Transcription of CCK2R was also increased in AGS-G<sub>R</sub> and RGM1 cells by gastrin through mechanisms partly dependent upon protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK). Gastrin significantly increased endogenous CCK2R expression in RGM1 cells, and CCK2R protein expression was elevated in the stomach of hypergastrinaemic animals. In mice with cryoulcers in the acid-secreting mucosa, CCK2R expression increased progressively in the regenerating mucosa adjacent to the ulcer repair margin, evident at 6 days postinjury and maximal at 13 days. <italic>De novo</italic> expression of CCK2R was observed in the submucosa beneath the repairing ulcer crater 6&#x02013;9 days postinjury. Many of the cells in mucosa and submucosa that expressed CCK2R in response to cryoinjury were identified as myofibroblasts, since they coexpressed vimentin and smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actin but not desmin. The data suggest that increased CCK2R expression might influence the outcome of epithelial inflammation or injury and that the response may be mediated in part by myofibroblasts.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Amidated peptides of the gastrin&#x02013;cholecystokinin (CCK) family exert their effects via two G-protein-coupled receptors, the CCK1 receptor, which has high affinity for CCK, and the CCK2 receptor (CCK2R), which has high affinity for both peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Noble <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dufresne <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). The CCK2R (formerly CCKBR) was originally defined in central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Innis &#x00026; Snyder, 1980</xref>), where it is widely distributed, notably in cerebral cortex and striatum, and where CCK is likely to be the most important endogenous ligand. In the periphery, the CCK2R is located primarily on parietal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kopin <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>) and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells within the gastric epithelium, where it mediates the actions of gastrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dockray <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), but expression has also been reported on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Reubi <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">de Weerth <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>), pancreatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Morisset, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Cayrol <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>) myenteric neurones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Mantyh <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>) and cells of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Mezey &#x00026; Palkovits, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Iwata <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Schmitz <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). The main established physiological function of gastrin is the regulation of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, principally indirectly, through histamine release from ECL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dockray <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that direct activation of the parietal cell CCK2R may be more important for parietal cell maturation and for proliferation and migration of gastric epithelial cells than for acute stimulation of gastric acid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Nagata <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Koh <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Friis-Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kirton <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dockray <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dimaline &#x00026; Varro, 2007</xref>). The physiological significance of the CCK2R on peripheral cells other than ECL cells and parietal cells remains to be established.</p><p>There are a number of reports that in some clinical or experimental situations, expression of the CCK2R is augmented or induced in sites other than those seen in physiological circumstances. Thus, expression of the CCK2R was seen on proliferating cells in a hypergastrinaemic transgenic mouse that has gastric hyperproliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nakajima <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>) and in the regenerative zone at the margins of experimentally induced cryoulcers in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schmassmann &#x00026; Reubi, 2000</xref>). Upregulated CCK2R expression has also been described in the epithelium of Barrett's oesophagus compared with normal oesophageal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Haigh <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>) and in intestinal epithelium of mice subjected to &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Ottewell <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). These data suggest that CCK2R expression may be upregulated during the hyperproliferation seen in response to inflammation and injury of gastrointestinal epithelia. Upregulation of the CCK2R has also been reported in response to its peripheral physiological ligand, gastrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Takeuchi <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nakajima <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gunther <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).

Experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal welfare committee. Mice were anaesthetized by isofluorane inhalation, and the abdomen was incised by a mid-line laparotomy. A cryoinjury was induced on the ventral serosal surface of the gastric corpus by applying, for 20 s, a 2 mm diameter stainless-steel probe cooled in liquid nitrogen, and the abdomen closed. After 2, 6, 9 or 13 days, the mice were killed by inhalation of increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations followed by cervical dislocation. Grossly visible damage to the mucosa was identified, and gastric tissue was immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature before being transferred to 20% sucrose at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. Tissue was embedded in Cryo-M-Bed (Bright Instrument Co. Ltd, Huntingdon, UK) and frozen to &#x02212;40&#x000b0;C in isopentane. Tissue was stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C prior to sectioning.

When cells were stressed by withdrawal of serum, CCK2R expression was upregulated, at least in part through transcriptional activation. The expression of CCK2R in cell lines was also upregulated by gastrin at close to physiological concentrations, and the receptor was upregulated <italic>in vivo</italic> in transgenic mice that were hypergastrinaemic. In normal gastric mucosa of C57BL/6 mice, CCK2R expression was restricted primarily to the epithelium, on parietal and ECL cells. One to 2 weeks following cryoulceration of the mucosa, there was intense expression of CCK2R at the repair margins of the ulcer and in the submucosa beneath it, in cells that were identified as myofibroblasts.</p><p>Numerous studies employing a variety of approaches indicate that in the normal acid-secreting mucosa, the CCK2R is expressed primarily on ECL and parietal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kopin <italic>et al.</italic> 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Prinz <italic>et al.</italic> 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kulaksiz <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dockray <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>), and this expression pattern was confirmed in the present study. The CCK2R plays a major role in the physiological regulation of gastric acid secretion, which is now believed to occur primarily through gastrin-stimulated histamine release from the ECL cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dockray <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). The importance for acute regulation of acid secretion of the parietal cell CCK2R is therefore open to question. Evidence is accumulating to suggest instead that the CCK2R may be crucial for parietal cell maturation and perhaps migration, as well as for the release of a number of paracrine mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Koh <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Friis-Hansen <italic>et al.</italic> 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Kirton <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dimaline &#x00026; Varro, 2007</xref>). Studies on rabbit gastric glands provided evidence for heterogeneity of the parietal cell population, with the acid secretory capacity of cells near to the base of the gland appearing to be lower than that of those from the mid- or upper regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Karam <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Interestingly, in the present study, colocalization of the CCK2R with the H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase &#x003b2; subunit was markedly greater in the base region of the gland, with much lower CCK2R expression in parietal cells towards the mid-glandular region. It seems plausible that this reflects a lesser role for the CCK2R in the more active acid secretory population of parietal cells and raises the possibility that it might also be involved in regulating non-acid secretory functions of the more deeply situated parietal cell population.</p><p>The factors that regulate expression of the CCK2R are not well known. Expression of the CCK2R is well documented in the pancreatic cancer cell line AR42J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Seva <italic>et al.</italic> 1994</xref>) and has been reported in the untransformed rat gastric mucosa-derived cell line RGM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Cui <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). In the present study, we were able to detect endogenous CCK2R expression at the level of both mRNA and protein in AR42J and RGM1 cells. Using luciferase&#x02013;reporter constructs we showed that a 196 bp fragment of the proximal promoter was sufficient to support basal CCK2R expression in RGM1 cells, and that consensus binding sites for SP1, GATA and C/EBP&#x003b2; were required for this expression. Similar data were obtained using AGS-G<sub>R</sub> cells. Putative binding sites for these transcription factors were also identified in the proximal promoters of the rat and mouse genes using the transcription element search system (TESS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess">http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess</ext-link>), suggesting that they are likely to be important determinants of CCK2R expression.</p><p>Several studies have sought associations between a CT repeat polymorphism (conserved as CA repeats in the rat and mouse promoters) that lies between 250 and 200 bp upstream of the start of transcription and panic disorder or schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Kennedy <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hamilton <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hattori <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>). No clear association was found and, in the present study, truncation of this region had little or no effect on basal transcription in RGM1 or AGS cells. Increases in CCK2R expression were seen in RGM1 and AGS cells in response to deprivation of growth factors by serum withdrawal for more than about 8 h. The response was at least in part due to changes in transcription, since expression of reporter constructs containing 1.7 kb of the CCK2R promoter was significantly elevated in similar circumstances. The data are consistent with the idea that expression of the CCK2R may respond to changes in the microenvironment, such as the alteration of growth factor profiles that might occur during responses to inflammation or injury <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Studies from a number of years ago that correlated serum gastrin concentrations with the capacity of gastric mucosal membrane preparations to bind radiolabelled G17 led to the suggestion that gastrin might stimulate the production of its own receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Takeuchi <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">1980</xref>). These findings remained unconfirmed for many years, although support for the idea came from recent studies using transgenic hypergastrinaemic mice and a pit cell precursor line, which suggested that gastrin induced expression of the CCK2R in pit cell precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nakajima <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Transient expression of the CCK2R in response to a relatively high concentration of G17 (10 n<sc>m</sc>) has also been reported in a PCR-based study using AR42J cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Gunther <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we showed that gastrin increased transcription of CCK2R promoter&#x02013;reporter constructs both in AGS-G<sub>R</sub> cells that are permanently transfected with the CCK2R and in untransformed RGM1 cells that endogenously express it. Transcription was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner from 100 p<sc>m</sc> to 10 n<sc>m</sc> G17, and increases in transcription were detectable within 2 h of stimulation. The response could be completely prevented by a CCK2R antagonist, and was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by inhibitors of PKC and MEK to a minimum of around 50% of control values. Previous studies have shown that a number of CCK2R-mediated increases in gene transcription are effected, at least in part, through PKC- and MEK-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Hocker <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Watson <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Raychowdhury <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Khan <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), and it seems this is also the case for gastrin-stimulated CCK2R expression. As with basal expression, the response was not dependent on the CT polymorphic region, but did depend upon intact C/EBP&#x003b2; and SP1 sites in the proximal promoter. In RGM1 cells, endogenous CCK2R mRNA abundance and protein levels were elevated around fivefold in response to 1 n<sc>m</sc> G17, and the response was in both cases significantly attenuated by a CCK2R antagonist.</p><p>To further address the relevance of these findings <italic>in vivo</italic>, we determined expression of the CCK2R in the stomach of a mouse model that has altered expression of the gastrin gene with consequential effects on circulating gastrin concentrations.

In these animals, a 50% increase in gastric CCK2R expression was seen compared with wild-type FVB control mice. These data are consistent with the notion that peripheral CCK2R expression may be chronically regulated by gastrin and provide support for earlier reports linking expression of a functional gastrin receptor with circulating hormone concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Takeuchi <italic>et al.</italic> 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">1980</xref>).</p><p>Aside from its primary physiological expression in ECL and parietal cells, a number of recent studies have reported increased or <italic>de novo</italic> expression of the CCK2R in other unspecified gastrointestinal cell types in some experimental or clinical circumstances. For example, expression was demonstrated by autoradiography in the margins of cryoulcers induced in rats within 5 days of injury, and ulcer repair was enhanced by induction of hypergastrinaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schmassmann &#x00026; Reubi, 2000</xref>). The cell type in which the CCK2R was induced was not identified, but they were presumed to be relatively undifferentiated cells derived from progenitor cells. Induction of CCK2R expression has been described in proliferating cells in a transgenic mouse with a gastric hyperproliferative phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nakajima <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). Expression of a functional CCK2R was also increased in the epithelium of Barrett's metaplasia, compared with unaffected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Haigh <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), and in the intestinal epithelium of mice following &#x003b3;-radiation-induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Ottewell <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that upregulation of the CCK2R occurs in a range of hyperproliferative conditions that are likely to include inflammation or injury to the gastrointestinal epithelium.</p><p>In a previous study, we reported that 2 days after cryoulceration of mouse gastric corpus mucosa, the intensity and distribution of CCK2R expression was largely unaltered from that seen in uninjured tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Khan <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>), and these findings were confirmed in the present study. However, during the subsequent repair of the injury, there was a progressive increase in CCK2R expression in the mucosa at the ulcer margins that was maximal after 13 days. This time course of CCK2R expression is consistent with that previously reported in rat gastric mucosa in response to cryoinjury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schmassmann &#x00026; Reubi, 2000</xref>). It seems plausible to suppose that a proportion of the postinjury CCK2R-expressing cells are likely to be relatively undifferentiated, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Schmassmann &#x00026; Reubi, 2000</xref>).</p><p>To further explore their identity, we performed colocalization studies with markers of smooth muscle-like cells. A substantial proportion of the cells that expressed the CCK2R, 9 days after cryoinjury, also expressed vimentin and smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actin but not desmin, which strongly suggests they are likely to be myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are a key mesenchymal cell type. In gastric glands, they are in close association with the neck or isthmus region and are thought to be important determinants of the stem cell niche, e.g. by secretion of growth factors and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Spradling <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Leedham <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">McCaig <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dimaline &#x00026; Varro, 2007</xref>). Whilst it might not, therefore, be surprising to see increased myofibroblast numbers in regions undergoing rapid regeneration of gastric glands, they have not hitherto been reported to express the CCK2R. Cells expressing vimentin were sparse in uninjured mucosa and showed little or no colocalization with CCK2R.</p><p>In addition to the increased mucosal postinjury expression of the CCK2R at the ulcer margins, intense areas of expression were seen in the submucosa beneath and adjacent to the ulcer that were maximal at 6&#x02013;9 days and had largely disappeared by 13 days. A significant proportion of these CCK2R-expressing submucosal cells were again identified as myofibroblasts on the basis of coexpression of vimentin and smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actin. It is well established that myofibroblasts have important functions in the response to inflammation and injury in the gastrointestinal tract and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Powell <italic>et al.</italic> 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Jackson <italic>et al.</italic> 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dimaline &#x00026; Varro, 2007</xref>). The origin of myofibroblasts generated in response to injury is to some extent dependent upon the nature of the pathology and the organ system affected. Commonly, they differentiate from fibroblasts, although transdifferentiation from epithelial cells or other mesenchymal cell types is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hinz <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>). The relationship between the myofibroblasts seen in submucosa and mucosa in the present study is unclear. The earlier appearance in submucosa may be a consequence of the nature of cryoulceration, where the initial site of the injury is the serosal surface of the stomach. It seems possible that some of the myofibroblasts appearing later in the mucosa may have migrated from the submucosa.</p><p>The mechanisms that lead to <italic>de novo</italic> expression of the CCK2R by myofibroblasts in response to ulceration of the gastric mucosa presently remain unclear. The functional consequences of such expression also remain to be established. In a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Varro <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>), gastrin was demonstrated to stimulate myofibroblast proliferation indirectly via release of matrix metalloproteinase 7 from epithelial cells. The present data suggest that in response to inflammation or injury, gastrin might act directly on myofibroblasts following induction of CCK2R expression, to further enhance epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal interactions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
