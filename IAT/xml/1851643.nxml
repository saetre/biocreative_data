Previous work by us and others showed that the antisense RNA MicA downregulates the synthesis of the outer membrane protein OmpA upon entry into stationary phase. This regulation is Hfq-dependent and occurs by MicA-dependent translational inhibition which facilitates mRNA decay. In this article, we investigate the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>micA</italic> gene. Induction of MicA is dependent on the alarmone ppGpp, suggestive of alternative <bold>&#x003c3;</bold> factor involvement, yet MicA accumulates in the absence of the general stress/stationary phase <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>S</sup>. We identified stress conditions that induce high MicA levels even during exponential growth&#x02014;a phase in which MicA levels are low (ethanol, hyperosmolarity and heat shock). Such treatments are sensed as envelope stress, upon which the extracytoplasmic sigma factor <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> is activated. The strict dependence of <italic>micA</italic> transcription on <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> is supported by three observations. Induced overexpression of <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> increases <italic>micA</italic> transcription, an <bold>&#x00394;</bold><italic>rpoE</italic> mutant displays undetectable MicA levels and the <italic>micA</italic> promoter has the consensus <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> signature. Thus, MicA is part of the <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> regulon and downregulates its target gene, <italic>ompA</italic>, probably to alleviate membrane stress.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteria meet adverse environmental conditions by rapid adaptive changes in gene expression patterns, thereby mounting appropriate responses. This most often involves transcriptional regulation, by repressors or activators, often under the control of two-component regulatory systems, and/or by alternative sigma (&#x003c3;) factors. In addition, a second level of posttranscriptional control is frequently involved. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a growing number of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have been implicated in the regulation of stress responses and virulence traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Many of these are conserved in enteric relatives, and quite a few sRNAs have since been identified in other bacteria as well.</p><p>Most of the sRNAs are antisense RNAs that inhibit (or, less frequently, activate) the translation of target mRNAs or promote their degradation. The ubiquitous RNA-binding protein Hfq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) is often required for regulatory activity, though its mechanism of action is not yet fully understood.</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>cis</italic>-encoded antisense RNAs in plasmids, most chromosomally encoded sRNAs are <italic>trans</italic>-encoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Their genes do not overlap target genes, and thus complementarity to the target mRNA is limited and often non-contiguous. Therefore, the location of an sRNA gene does not automatically identify the target gene. Assigning functions for new sRNAs has been based on screening for downstream effects in strains lacking the sRNA, or overexpressing it. Microarray analyses, two-dimensional protein gels, phenotypic tests and bioinformatics-aided complementarity searches have resulted in the identification of targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Conceptually, sRNAs are expected to be under appropriate transcriptional control, so that their induction matches requirements for their regulatory activity. This appears to be borne out by observations: for instance, RyhB is under control of the Fur repressor. When iron concentration is low, Fur repression of the <italic>ryhB</italic> promoter is abolished, and synthesized RyhB inhibits the synthesis of several iron-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A similar logic guides the expression characteristics of several other sRNAs.</p><p>Many sRNAs are upregulated immediately before or upon entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This stress response in <italic>E. coli</italic> has been studied extensively and is characterized by major physiological changes arising from orchestrated alterations in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), the majority of which are dependent on the stress/stationary phase &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>. This transcription factor, in turn, is under intricate control involving several environmental signals that converge on the expression of its gene, the translation or stability of its mRNA and the activity/stability of the protein itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Among these regulators are two antisense sRNAs, DsrA and RprA, that are induced by different signals and enhance translation of the <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Transcriptome and proteome analyses have been used to chart the &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> regulon, which includes transcriptional regulators important for the scavenging of nutrients, such as Crp and the two-component Ntr and Pho systems, and many genes whose products help in adaptation to stationary phase. Recently, microarray data have contributed to the understanding of the transcriptomes of other &#x003c3; factors, such as the heatshock &#x003c3;<sup>H</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and the extracytoplasmic stress &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Interestingly, &#x003c3;<sup>H</sup> responds not only to heat stress, but is itself transcriptionally upregulated in a &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), perhaps indicative of some regulatory &#x02018;hierarchy&#x02019;.</p><p>The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is specifically induced in response to conditions that culminate in changes within the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Its intracellular levels are high, almost as high as those of the housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is sequestered at the cytoplasmic membrane by an anti-&#x003c3; factor, RseA. Upon accumulation of misfolded proteins in the periplasm, ethanol exposure, heatshock and hyperosmotic stress, the distress signals are perceived by the protease DegS. Successive cleavages of RseA by DegS and RseP, a second protease, release the active &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> into the cytoplasm to compete for RNA polymerase. More than 80 genes are induced in response to &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is an essential protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), which likely testifies to the importance of the periplasmic and outer membrane compartments for many life processes.</p><p>We and others have studied the sRNA MicA (earlier: SraD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>)). MicA accumulates upon entry into stationary phase and, aided by Hfq, downregulates the translation of the outer membrane protein OmpA, concomitantly inducing the degradation of the <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The signals and effectors that control transcription and accumulation of MicA were unknown. In this work, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of MicA under a variety of stress conditions. We find that transcription of MicA is strictly dependent on &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, making it the first sRNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> shown to be an exclusive member of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Promoter sequence alignment</title><p>Selected <italic>micA</italic> upstream sequences from several enterobacterial genomes (gamma proteobacteriaceae subdivision) were aligned.

Adaptation to stationary phase growth involves the major stress response sigma factor, &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>, whose synthesis and activity is in turn induced by a number of different stress signals&#x02014;among these are acid stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Hence, we tested which environmental stresses would upregulate the levels of MicA, and whether &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> was required.</p><p>In a first set of experiments, we monitored the levels of MicA in response to stress challenge during logarithmic growth, the phase at which intracellular MicA (and &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>) concentrations are normally low. The <italic>E. coli</italic> strain MC4100<italic>relA</italic><sup>+</sup> was subjected to stress treatments as described in Materials and Methods. After 30&#x02009;min, total RNA was extracted for Northern blot analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A shows that loading-corrected MicA levels (5S rRNA as control) were significantly increased, compared to mock treatment, upon heat shock (&#x0223c;threefold; cf. lane 30&#x02013;30 to 30&#x02013;42&#x000b0;C), ethanol stress (&#x0223c;sevenfold; ethanol), and growth at hypoosmolarity(&#x0223c;ninefold; NaCl). Only a marginal increase (&#x0223c;twofold) was observed when <italic>E. coli</italic> was exposed to hyperosmolarity (lane Sucrose) and bile salts failed to induce. The increased levels of MicA after ethanol treatment were accompanied by a significant processing/partial degradation of this RNA. Stresses such as osmotic shock (whether hyperosmotic or hypoosmotic) are known to induce the <italic>rpoS</italic> regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Thus, we tested whether the observed patterns of MicA upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) required &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>. An isogenic strain pair, <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>+</sup>/&#x00394;<italic>rpoS</italic>, was subjected to selected stress conditions, and intracellular MicA levels were assessed by Northern blot as before. The strong induction of MicA accumulation by, in particular, NaCl, is &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Though a contribution of &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> is not ruled out by these experiments, the experiment indicates that another &#x003c3; factor is responsible for MicA transcription. Note that in early exponential phase, MicA levels were higher (&#x0223c;threefold) in a &#x00394;<italic>rpoS</italic> than in an <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>+</sup> background.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>E. coli</italic> mutant strains exhibit aberrant MicA levels</title><p>Earlier attempts to transcribe the <italic>micA</italic> gene <italic>in vitro</italic> by RNA polymerase holoenzyme (containing &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>) had been unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>; K.U., unpublished). This suggests that an alternative &#x003c3; factor is required for transcription. &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> was tentatively ruled out by the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B. Sigma factor competition, resulting in the exchange of the housekeeping &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> for alternative &#x003c3; factors, is thought to be dependent on the nutritional stress signal ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Thus, we monitored the growth-phase-dependent accumulation of MicA in strains carrying mutations that decrease or abolish ppGpp synthesis (<italic>spoT, relA</italic>1), and strains that are either <italic>rpoS</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> or <italic>cyaA</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup> (adenyl cyclase). The <italic>relA</italic><sup>+</sup>-strain showed stationary phase induction as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B, left panels). Induction was only slightly affected in an isogenic <italic>relA</italic>1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, middle panel), but severely impaired when both ppGpp synthetases, SpoT and RelA, were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, middle panel). More specifically, we consistently noted a shift in the timing of MicA induction in the <italic>relA</italic>1 mutant strain, which we attribute to SpoT-dependent ppGpp production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B; cf. lanes 7 and 8 to lanes 3 and 4); MicA began to accumulate already in late exponential phase (lane 7), but stationary phase levels were identical to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B; cf. lanes 8 and 9 to lanes 4 and 5). A ppGpp requirement for growth-phase-dependent upregulation of the sRNA is consistent with transcription being dependent on an alternative &#x003c3; factor, although some &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> promoters are known to be affected by this alarmone as well. Compared to its wild-type counterpart, the <italic>rpoS</italic> mutant strain showed, however, only a modest reduction of &#x0223c;40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, right panel). Thus, &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> cannot be the main factor driving MicA transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B), even though a minor contribution may be due to redundancy of &#x003c3;-factor recognition during transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). It is worth noting that accumulation of MicA could have been caused by a <italic>decrease</italic> in its decay rate rather than an <italic>increase</italic> in transcription rate. Rifampicin run-out experiments, however, failed to show significant differences in MicA half-life in early and late growth (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, the <italic>cyaA</italic> mutant strain (deficient in cAMP production) showed an entirely different expression pattern. It produced &#x0003e;ten fold higher levels of MicA in early exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, right panel, OD<sub>600</sub> 0.3) compared to wild-type (lane 2). MicA levels in the <italic>cyaA</italic> mutant remained high throughout growth until OD<sub>600</sub> &#x0223c; 2.4. At this point in the growth curve, the MicA level of the wild-type strain approached that of the <italic>cyaA</italic> strain. The possible involvement of catabolite repression, which is relieved in a <italic>cyaA</italic> mutant strain, was tested by comparisons of MicA levels in both mutant and wild-type cells in the presence or absence of glucose. Glucose did not affect MicA levels differentially in the two strains (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>micA</italic> upstream region is highly conserved and has a <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> recognition signature</title><p>The experiments that indicated membrane stresses (ethanol and osmolarity changes) to be inducers of MicA accumulation, and the functional connection of MicA as a regulator of an outer-membrane protein, suggested &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> to be responsible for MicA transcription. We analyzed the promoter region of the <italic>micA</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> and several enterobacteria in which homologs could be identified. Since the +1 transcription start site had been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, data not shown), the putative promoters and their upstream regions could be compared to each other, and to the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> consensus binding motifs identified by the Gross and Kormanec labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The BLAST-aligned putative <italic>micA</italic> promoter sequences show all characteristics of the <italic>rpoE</italic> promoter sequence, which is known to be transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>. Strong sequence conservation within the &#x02212;35, and &#x02212;10 boxes was observed in <italic>micA</italic> promoters of <italic>E. coli</italic> and several relatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Full sequence conservation was seen in the &#x02018;AA&#x02019; tract of the &#x02212;35 element, which was recently postulated to be essential for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Spacer and discriminator regions are of median size at 16 and 6&#x02009;bp, respectively. The &#x02212;10 box contains an invariable C-residue found in &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-controlled promoters, and the region upstream of the &#x02212;35 box comprises a conserved AT-rich element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Interestingly, this element differs in <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, a bacterial species that does not show growth-phase-dependent MicA upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The <italic>micA</italic> promoter (without upstream sequences) is 85% (&#x02212;35 box) and 100% identical (&#x02212;10 box) in sequence to the P3 promoter of <italic>rpoH</italic>&#x02014;a promoter that is exclusively transcribed by &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup> results in increased MicA accumulation</title><p>In order to ascertain &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-driven transcription of MicA, we tested whether overexpression of the ECF would upregulate <italic>micA</italic> expression. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain LMG194 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), carrying a multicopy plasmid bearing an arabinose-inducible copy of the <italic>rpoE</italic> gene, was either induced or mock-treated.

If true, a <italic>micA</italic> promoter fused to a reporter gene should show growth-phase-dependent upregulation. Plasmid p30-luc carries the <italic>micA</italic> promoter in front of a <italic>luc</italic> (luciferase) reporter gene. The control plasmid pZE12b-luc is promoterless. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells harboring either of the two plasmids were diluted after overnight growth and allowed to grow. Samples were withdrawn for determination of luciferase activity at the OD<sub>600</sub> values indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A. Background luciferase activity from the control strain (promoterless plasmid) was subtracted from that obtained from the corresponding lysates of the strain carrying p30-luc, and induction values were calculated setting the luciferase activity at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2 to unity. In parallel, MicA accumulation was measured by quantitation of Northern blots and, at the same time, OD-values. Here, RNA samples were taken from the control-plasmid-carrying strain since the high-copy plasmid p30-luc might out-titrate &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, resulting in lower-than-normal MicA levels (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A shows both the induction of luciferase activity driven by the <italic>micA</italic> promoter (values normalized to OD<sub>600</sub>) and the MicA RNA levels from the control strain (normalized to 5S rRNA signals). Induction kinetics were similar for <italic>micA</italic> promoter activity (<italic>luc</italic>-values) and MicA accumulation. At the latest time point, MicA levels had dropped somewhat, whereas transcription activity stayed higher. Additional confirmation of direct &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> involvement emerges from the kinetics of <italic>micA</italic> transcription (assayed by <italic>luc</italic> expression from pluc-30) upon arabinose induction of plasmid pAC-rpoE4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).

No significant increase in luminescence was measured in a strain carrying the promoterless plasmid pZE12b-luc (data not shown). Taken together, these results confirm that the effect of the <italic>rpoE</italic> gene product on MicA levels can be accounted for, primarily or exclusively, by an increase in transcription rate. </p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of <italic>rpoE</italic> induces downregulation of OmpA synthesis</title><p>The antisense RNA MicA inhibits OmpA synthesis upon entry of cells into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The results presented above suggest that increased &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity in stationary phase, and under certain stress conditions, is responsible for increased transcription and, thus, accumulation of MicA. Thus, increases in &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> should downregulate <italic>de novo</italic> OmpA synthesis even in exponential phase when MicA levels are normally very low. We grew strain LMG194::pAC-rpoE4 to early exponential phase in minimal medium lacking cysteine and methionine. The culture was split in two, one was induced for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> by arabinose, the other remained uninduced. Cells were pulse-labeled with <sup>35</sup>S-Met and, subsequently, chased with a molar excess of unlabeled methionine. The labeled OmpA and &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> proteins were separately immunoprecipitated from the protein extracts and analyzed on gels. A comparison of the induced and uninduced samples confirmed arabinose-dependent upregulation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, cf. lanes 1 and 2) and showed that, concomintantly, the intensity of the OmpA-specific band was decreased (cf. lanes 3 and 4). This means that, even in the exponential phase, a high activity/synthesis of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> results in higher MicA levels that in turn inhibits OmpA synthesis; this does not rule out the possibility that other &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-driven sRNAs may have minor inhibitory effects on <italic>ompA</italic> expression. Additionally, we note that induction of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> alters the protein synthesis pattern during the pulse (cf. lanes 5 and 6), in good agreement with the documented global effects expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). </p></sec><sec><title>MicA is exclusively transcribed by <bold>&#x003c3;</bold><sup>E</sup></title><p>The experiments above indicate that &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is responsible for MicA transcription and, hence, accumulation. &#x003c3; factors are known to display redundancy; for example, the <italic>rpoS</italic> promoter is recognized by both &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), and overlapping functions on some promoters have also been observed for &#x003c3;<sup>H</sup> and &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).

This suggests that other &#x003c3; factors cannot substitute for <italic>micA</italic> transcription. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this communication, we address the regulation of MicA RNA, the antisense regulator of the outer membrane protein OmpA. Previous work has shown that MicA accumulates before entry into stationary phase, concomitant with a decrease in the levels of the <italic>ompA</italic> mRNA and OmpA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). The results presented here indicate that MicA accumulation is controlled at the transcriptional level, and that &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is the transcription factor responsible. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows that, in particular, envelope-stress-related treatments (ethanol, high salt, heat shock) caused upregulation of MicA in exponential phase&#x02014;a condition where MicA concentration is normally low. Analyses of growth-phase-dependent induction of MicA in mutant strains indicated ppGpp, the alarmone that facilitates &#x003c3; factor exchange on RNA polymerase, to be required for upregulation. In contrast, the presence or absence of the stationary phase/stress &#x003c3;<sup>S</sup> had only small effects on induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The observation that a &#x00394;<italic>cyaA</italic> strain displayed high levels of MicA even in exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) was initially puzzling. Recently, however, it was found that the absence of cAMP results in strong induction of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>); the mechanism by which this occurs is as yet unknown. Since the MicA-inducing stresses (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) as well as stationary-phase growth have previously been associated with an increase in synthesis and/or activity of the ECF &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), this factor is strongly suggested to be involved in <italic>micA</italic> regulation.</p><p>The recent characterization of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-driven promoters identified characteristic recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). A comparison of the <italic>micA</italic> promoter in <italic>E. coli</italic> to homologous regions in enterobacterial relatives showed high conservation and an excellent match to the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Experimental support for &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcription comes from induced overexpression of a plasmid-borne copy of the <italic>rpoE</italic> gene; an increase in &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) resulted in rapid accumulation of MicA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Since a transcriptional <italic>micA</italic> promoter&#x02013;<italic>luc</italic> reporter gene fusion showed an upregulation that was roughly proportional to MicA accumulation throughout growth, regulation must be primarily or exclusively transcriptional. Finally, since MicA was virtually undetectable in a &#x00394;<italic>rpoE</italic> strain, but accumulated normally in its wild-type sibling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), <italic>micA</italic> gene expression is strictly dependent on &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>. Two papers published during completion of this manuscript also reported on &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent <italic>micA</italic> regulation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The paper by Valentin-Hansen's group furthermore identified the RybB RNA as an additional member of the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon. This sRNA targets the <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, extracytoplasmic stress was believed to be solely responsible for an upregulation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activity. Conditions&#x02014;such as heat, overproduction of OMPs, changes in osmolarity, etc. &#x02014;that cause misfolded proteins to accumulate in the periplasm are sensed by the DegS protease. A proteolytic signal transduction cascade ultimately results in cleavage of the anti-&#x003c3; RseA. &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is released into the cytoplasm and competes for core RNA polymerase, and this induces dramatic global changes in the cell's expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon comprises genes involved in maintaining or restoring membrane integrity, but also heat shock, DNA repair, chaperone and other classes of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Recently, an alternative RseA-independent pathway has been reported. Here, stationary phase growth <italic>per se</italic> may be sensed as nutritional deprivation through accumulation of ppGpp, and &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> is activated by a mechanism that is not yet understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). With respect to MicA induction, it is likely that both pathways are used. Growth-phase-dependent upregulation of MicA is dependent on ppGpp, and induced membrane stresses likewise increase MicA concentration. In both cases, <italic>ompA</italic> regulation occurs in an <italic>hfq</italic>-dependent fashion.</p><p>It makes sense that the structure of the bacterial envelope is tightly regulated. The protein composition of the outer membrane (channels, porins, transporters) determines the flux of metabolites, salts and ions in and out of the cell. Cell-surface proteins and structures such as flagella, fimbriae and curli are also points of contact with eukaryotic cells/other bacteria/bacteriophages, and virulence can be dependent on proper outer membrane remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Thus, surface properties and the appropriate levels of envelope proteins must be monitored and controlled according to the prevailing conditions. Much of this adaptive regulation is transcriptional and uses global-stress-responsive, two-component systems, &#x003c3; factors and other regulatory proteins. For instance, the <italic>ompF</italic> porin gene is controlled by EnvZ (sensor kinase)/OxyR (response regulator) and several other regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The abundance of binding sites for regulators such as HN-S, OmpR, Lrp and others, in the promoter regions of outer-membrane protein genes, testifies to regulatory complexity.</p><p>A second layer of control is posttranscriptional and involves sRNAs. The <italic>ompF</italic> gene was found to be regulated by the sRNA MicF, the founding member of the chromosomally encoded antisense RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Work in recent years has extended the list of OMP-regulatory sRNAs. MicC and MicA are antisense inhibitors of <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompA</italic> porin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). OmrA and OmrB, two sRNAs of almost identical sequence but with different expression patterns, downregulate the mRNA levels of at least four OMP genes, <italic>ompT, fecA, cirA</italic> and <italic>fepA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>), possibly by an antisense mechanism. RybB downregulates <italic>ompC</italic> and <italic>ompW</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), and more than eight genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The RseX RNA, when ectopically expressed at high copy, rescues an <italic>rseP</italic> mutant strain that is incapable of mounting the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). This occurs by downregulation of the <italic>ompA</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> genes, thus decreasing the abundance of misfolded OMPs. So far, RseX has not been detected from its chromosomal copy. All these sRNAs are known or suspected to act by base-pairing to target mRNAs, and appear to require Hfq for regulatory efficiency and/or intracellular stability.</p><p>Expression patterns suggest the OMP-related sRNAs to be under transcriptional control, even though the regulators responsible are in most cases unknown. MicF, OmrA and OmrB are regulated by OxyR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Upon oxidative stress, MicF is additionally regulated by MarR and SoxR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The finding that envelope stress, and entry into stationary phase, leads to a &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent upregulation of MicA and RybB (this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) is therefore not surprising.</p><p>Of the functionally assigned sRNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, close to half are regulators of outer-membrane proteins. Whether this is coincidental or not is unclear. So far, many OMPs are targeted by sRNAs, and overlapping regulation is observed. For instance, both MicA and RseX can inhibit <italic>ompA</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Conversely, one sRNA can affect the expression of multiple <italic>omp</italic> genes. The RybB RNA in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> downregulates more than eight <italic>omp</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). The fitness of bacteria must be dependent on adequate transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of outer-membrane proteins. The frequent association of sRNA-genes with neighboring <italic>omp</italic> genes (which are <italic>not</italic> targeted by the sRNA) suggests a complex circuitry that can modulate membrane properties in response to changing requirements. It may well be that the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon comprises additional regulatory sRNAs targeting <italic>omp</italic> mRNAs; global analyses of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent transcripts showed downregulation rather than upregulation of some <italic>omp</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Some of these cases may be explained by the action of hitherto unidentified &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>-dependent sRNAs that would help to decrease OMP levels, thereby relieving membrane stress.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge support from the Swedish Research Council and from the European Commission (EU-STREP FOSRAK and EU-STREP BacRNAs), all to E.G.H.
