Correlational analysis based on microarray data yielded a larger "look-up table" of genes whose regulation likely contributes to pain variability.

A major cause of this type of pain is axotomy-triggered alteration in the expression of genes in corresponding dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Gene regulation directly alters the phenotype of neurons that have been axotomized, and in addition may affect neighboring uninjured DRG neurons as well as spinal cord neurons, and glia in both the cord and DRGs. One consequence is the development of electrical hyperexcitability and consequent ectopic neural discharge in affected neurons. Another is altered levels of neurotransmitters, receptors and neuro-immune mediators. These changes can lead to pain hypersensibility through abnormal signal processing in the peripheral and central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Identification of the genes involved in pain hypersensibility has been the objective of a number of prior studies. This work has revealed that many hundreds of genes are significantly regulated in DRGs in neuropathic pain models (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]). Only a small fraction of these, however, is likely to contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability and pain. Most are presumably involved in other nerve injury-triggered phenomena such as inflammation, tissue repair, nerve regeneration and apoptosis. Strategies are needed for vetting which changes are causally related to neuropathic pain, and which are not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Here we have implemented such a strategy.</p><p>Our approach, correlational analysis, is based on the fact that pain phenotype is highly variable among individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Correlational analysis begins with quantification of pain phenotype on the one hand, and associated change in gene expression (or any other neurobiological parameter) on the other, in a variety of mouse strains. Then one searches for genes in which the degree of regulation correlates with the degree of altered pain phenotype. If up- or down-regulation of a particular gene transcript is an important pain substrate, then the degree of regulation should correlate across strains with the intensity of the pain.</p><p>It is not expected that correlational analysis, alone, will identify individual pain genes. Correlations can arise by chance, particularly considering practical limits on the number of mouse strains that can be analyzed, and the large numbers of transcripts that need to be examined simultaneously. Nonetheless, this approach can deliver an enriched pool of candidates for secondary analysis in mice, and ultimately for confirmation in human pain cohorts. Here we correlated neuropathic pain phenotype with nerve injury-evoked changes in gene expression in DRGs in five inbred mouse strains. First we report a limited test of the idea in which a small number of candidate genes previously implicated in neuropathic pain was hybridized in situ to DRG sections from the five mouse strains. The degree of regulation found was correlated against pain behavior. We then report results of a genome-wide correlational analysis based on regulation data obtained from Affymetrix expression microarrays supported by TaqMan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Strain differences in pain response</title><p>Consistent with previous studies using the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] we found that tactile allodynia was present in some animals as early as 1 day postoperatively (dpo) and reached a peak by 3 dpo. This peak was maintained until at least 7 dpo, and thereafter it tended to decline. The response magnitude varied among strains (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The ranking of the three strains tested at 2 dpo, from most to least sensitive, was AKR&#x0003e;B6&#x0003e;CBA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). This is in agreement with rankings in independent samples of all five strains mice assessed at 4 and 7 dpo (AKR&#x0003e;C58&#x0003e;C3H&#x0003e;B6&#x0003e;CBA, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) although, as is to be expected, the absolute values for hypersensitivity differed somewhat. The ranking for heat allodynia was AKR&#x0003e;CBA&#x0003e;C3H&#x0003e;B6&#x0003e;C58 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Autotomy behavior in mice develops at a slower pace than tactile and heat allodynia. It emerges over the first two weeks following hindlimb denervation and then approaches an asymptote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Rank order was C3H&#x0003e;CBA&#x0003e;B6&#x0003e;AKR&#x0003e;C58 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). RM-ANOVA indicated overall phenotypic differences among the five strains (p &#x0003c; 0.01).

Thus any gene regulation essential for the initiation and maturation of this pain behavior would already have occurred by 3 dpo. We know that regulation is detectable in many more genes 3 dpo than 1 dpo (see below) and it is likely that the expression of additional and/or different genes might be regulated at later time points. Regulation of such late responding genes might be important for the long-term maintenance of neuropathic pain behavior, or for its eventual decline, but not for its early stages. Such genes would not have been identified in our analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>The six genes selected for correlational analysis using in situ hybridization as a monitor of gene regulation were: <italic>Scn10a</italic>, <italic>Scn11a</italic>, <italic>P2rx3, Trpa1</italic>, <italic>Trpv1, Trpm8</italic>.

There were two objectives: 1) to facilitate development of the methods needed for microarray analysis based on the small amounts of mRNA extractable from individual mouse DRGs, and 2) to evaluate the sensitivity of the system using marker genes predicted, on the basis of prior studies, to be regulated in the L5DRG following L5 spinal nerve transection. Expression in ganglia taken from mice 3 dpo (n = 10) was compared to the corresponding ganglia from sham operated mice (n = 8). Eight genes were examined including two drawn from the in situ hybridization analysis. Seven of the eight are known to be significantly regulated in L5DRGs in rats following sciatic nerve transection (<italic>Gal, Pacap, Cchl2a, Sprr1a, C-Jun, Trpv1 </italic>and <italic>Scn11a</italic>) while one is not regulated (<italic>Mmpcp1; </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]).</p><p>Reproducibility among replicate samples from individual DRGs was high as reflected in very low coefficients of variation, as was consistency across mice in the operated and sham groups (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). TaqMan analysis revealed that the seven genes regulated in rat DRGs are likewise regulated in the mouse, whereas <italic>Mmpcp1</italic>, which is not regulated in the rat, is also not regulated in the mouse.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Galanin </italic>is up-regulated and <italic>Scn11a </italic>is down-regulated following spinal nerve ligation (SNL)</bold>.

Here we compared baseline gene expression, and regulation following SNL surgery, in all five mouse strains. As observed for B6 mice in "step 1", individual variability was low within strains, confirming the feasibility of carrying out across strains comparisons. Results for two strains, C3H and C58, are shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. The degree of resolution among DRGs from individual mice was sufficient to allow us to use these data to independently verify that the SNL surgery and the DRG identification had been done as intended, before actually applying cDNA to the expression microarrays. This facility is illustrated by outlier values for <italic>Gal </italic>and <italic>Scn11a </italic>expression in two ostensibly nerve injured mice, both C58. Expression levels in these two mice corresponded to sham operated mice and differed significantly from the other nerve injured mice (arrows in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Importantly, the outlier data came from the same individual mice in the case of both marker genes. Our interpretation is that in these two mice either the L5 segment had been misidentified during surgery or tissue dissection, or that the nerve injury had been incomplete. All data from these two outlier mice were removed prior to microarray analysis. No such outliers occurred among the C3H or B6 mice. Outlier values for <italic>Gal </italic>and <italic>Scn11a </italic>were also found in two AKR mice (one operated, one sham) and in one operated CBA mouse. These animals were also eliminated from the microarray analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray analysis of gene expression and regulation</title><p>Profiles of gene expression were generated using Affymetrix mouse whole-genome microarrays for the L5 and L4 DRGs on the operated side for each individual mouse in all five strains. Nerve-injury induced regulation was then calculated using the Resolver software by comparing like ganglia taken from individual nerve injured mice and the average of sham operated mice as described in the Methods. This yielded a value for fold up- or down-regulation for each gene, for both ganglia. For the strains-based analysis values for the individual ganglia were averaged within strains to yield the mean fold change (&#x000b1; variance) of each expressed gene for each of the five strains. Substantial differences were observed across strains in the baseline expression level of many genes as determined from expression profiles in the sham operated animals. Likewise, and most important for the present analysis, there were substantial across-strains differences in the degree of gene regulation comparing nerve injured and sham operated mice of a given strain. For some of these genes, strain-specific differences in regulation correlated with strain-specific difference in nerve injury-induced pain behavior.</p><p>In all five strains a large number of transcripts met our predetermined criterion for significant regulation as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. Averaging over the five mouse strains a mean of 2,552 &#x000b1; 477 genes were significantly regulated in the L5DRG, representing 11.6% of the 22,002 genes significantly expressed, on average. The 20 genes with the greatest fold up-regulation, and the 20 with the greatest fold down-regulation, in one of the strains (AKR, 3dpo) are provided as on-line supplemental material (see additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The number of genes regulated had doubled from 1 dpo to 3 dpo in the two strains studied at both time-points (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). At 3 dpo this number ranged from 1931 (in B6 mice) to 3053 (in C58 mice), with 3927 transcripts significantly regulated in at least one strain. There was only a small preponderance of down-regulated genes over up-regulated genes.

Regulation was based on a comparison with mean expression values from the sham operated mice of the same strain. In addition we plotted the degree of allodynia against the absolute signal intensity for gene expression in the axotomized L5DRGs. Both plots included 26 data points (9 AKR mice, 9 CBA mice and 8 B6 mice).</p><p>Based on the log-ratio data 108 out of the 2434 transcripts (4.4%) that were significantly regulated on average in these three strains yielded a q-value of &#x02264; 0.05 based on log ratio expression values (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). From measurements of absolute signal intensity 203 of the 2434 transcripts (8.3%) met this criterion. Overlap in these two lists was considerable. Nearly half of the transcripts in the list of 108 transcripts also appeared on the list of 203 transcripts (46/108).

In our material, &#x0003e;11% of all expressed genes, 2552 on average, were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated in the L5DRG 3 days following transection of the L5 spinal nerve. This number is larger than prior estimates probably because of the proximal location of the lesion, and the improved protocol for detecting change. In common with prior estimates, however, it highlights a fundamental challenge. The sheer number of regulated genes means that additional methods are needed to identify which individual transcripts play an important role in pain sensation versus other processes induced by axotomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using correlational analysis we considerably shortened the list of candidates. In contrast, we found that very few genes were regulated in the L4DRG following transection of the L5 spinal nerve. This is surprising in light of functional studies that have argued that abnormal activity in "uninjured" L4DRG nociceptors may be important for the development of tactile allodynia in the SNL model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Perhaps the relevant changes occur in sensory signaling processes not related to altered gene expression in the L4DRG. The observations on the L4DRG confirm that the massive regulation seen in the L5DRG was in fact related to axotomy.</p><p>We recognize that the shortened gene list still includes many transcripts unrelated to neuropathic pain. Assuming random assortment, 5% of transcripts are expected to correlate with pain phenotype at p &#x02264; 0.05 by chance alone. However, despite residual contamination transcripts whose regulation is functionally related to pain behavior are expected to be retained at higher frequency than pain-neutral transcripts, yielding significant enrichment. At the most optimistic, assuming that all functionally relevant genes were captured by our correlation procedure, at least 95% enrichment is expected. Thus, while the lists of correlated transcripts remain too long to permit direct selection of candidate pain genes, they constitute a valuable and relatively bias-free look-up table, a tool for screening candidates derived from other approaches. The list, however, is clearly not complete. In addition to pain-correlated genes missed, there is no inherent biological contradiction to the possibility that some genes are functionally related to pain phenotype but that their regulation does not contribute importantly to strain differences.</p><p>Might the gene lists be further enriched by increasing the stringency of the selection criterion from p &#x02264; 0.05 to, say, p &#x02264; 0.01? While not impossible, given the intrinsic noise present in the phenotyping process we believe that this step would be more likely to eliminate functionally significant transcripts. This is because within the enriched list, genes with the highest correlation coefficients are not much more likely to be functionally related to pain than those with lesser, but still high correlation coefficients. Further vetting requires additional biological information. For example, there is a clear benefit to increasing the number of data points used to generate correlations. We accomplished this in three of the five strains studied by collecting phenotypic data (on tactile allodynia) from individual mice rather than relying on strain means. This resulted in a reduction in the number of genes with significant correlation coefficients, presumably by removing more false positive results than true positive results. Related approaches are to increase the number of mouse strains studied and the behavioral diversity among them.</p><p>Two other enrichment approaches have been attempted in the past. In one, lists of regulated transcripts were assembled using a variety of different rodent models of painful neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. As expected, for each model hundreds of transcripts were significantly regulated in the axotomized DRGs. Lists were shortened by identifying genes similarly regulated in more than one model. This strategy is likely to reduce random noise, but it is also likely to capture regulated genes that are not related to pain. Transcripts related to regeneration and apoptosis, for example, would all be positively selected for. The approach also makes the risky assumption that different pain models (diagnoses) share the same underlying pathophysiology. If this is not the case then pain-related genes would be systematically excluded.</p><p>A second approach compared genes regulated in the DRG following nerve injury in two rat strains that had a consistent difference in pain phenotype in the SNL neuropathy model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Although closer in concept to our study, the rat strains used were not congenic, or even particularly close in genetic background. For this reason observed differences in gene regulation may well have reflected pain-neutral differences in genetic background. Correlations based on only two strains provide zero degrees of freedom. We used five strains, and alternatively 26 individual mice (from three strains) to generate correlations. In this context it is worth noting that not only does baseline gene expression level within a particular tissue (e.g. DRG) vary among mouse strains, but it also varies among tissues and among cell types within tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our in situ hybridization data affirm this to be the case with respect to DRG neurons of varying size, at least for some transcripts. An example is up-regulation of <italic>Trpv1 </italic>in CBA mice and down-regulation in B6 mice, and the de novo appearance of <italic>Trpv1 </italic>in DRG cells of medium and large size, but only in CBA mice.</p><p>An intrinsic limitation of microarray based studies, including ours, is that massive multiple hypothesis testing undermines the ability to establish statistical significance for any given transcript identified. This limitation is only partly eased using FDR analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Ultimately, our enriched list of pain-related genes needs to be subjected to secondary screens. In situ hybridization is one example. Although this method is too resource intensive to be used to screen large numbers of transcripts, it represents an independent implementation of correlational analysis. The overall pattern of gene regulation seen in the arrays was reiterated in all six candidate genes subjected to in situ analysis. However, the across-strains pattern was reproduced in only two of the six. There are several possible reasons for this difference between microarray and in situ measurements. Microarray (and TaqMan) analysis integrates over the entire ganglion, including neurons, glia and other resident cells, and includes cells with low expression levels. The cellular source of the mRNA is not identified. Likewise, the method does not take into account the possibility of up-regulation in one cell population balanced by down-regulation in another. Finally, stable expression levels in many cells may mask significant regulation in a small but important subpopulation.</p><p>Interestingly, the degree of regulation correlated significantly with pain phenotype for two of the six candidate genes studied with in situ hybridization (33%;<italic>Scn11a </italic>and <italic>Trpm8</italic>). This yield was much higher than for the array analysis which considered all regulated genes (p &#x0003c; 0.001). This outcome, which presumably reflects the additional information that underlay the choice of the six candidates, lends validation to the correlational approach. Regulation of the Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1; subunit <italic>Scn11a </italic>correlated with levels of spontaneous pain behavior, and regulation of the cool receptor <italic>Trpm8 </italic>correlated with heat hypersensibility. For <italic>Scn11a</italic>, expression was reduced in all strains, with the degree of reduction minimal in animals that exhibited a high level of ongoing pain behavior and maximal in strains with minimal ongoing pain. A good deal of evidence links Na<sup>+ </sup>channels, including <italic>Scn11a</italic>, to the emergence of ectopic afferent hyperexcitability after nerve injury and consequent spontaneous firing and spontaneous neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The observed correlation is therefore consistent with pain-protected mouse strains showing the greatest level of <italic>Scn11a </italic>down-regulation. We note, however, that mice with null mutation of <italic>Scn11a </italic>continue to show tactile allodynia in neuropathy models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These knockout mice have not been checked for autotomy.</p><p>For <italic>Trpm8</italic>, down-regulation occasioned reduced heat allodynia. <italic>Trpm8 </italic>functions as a cold transducer in primary afferent nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The relation to thermal sensation is obvious, but the link to altered heat response requires further investigation. Cold allodynia in the SNL model has not been compared in our series of mouse strains. In intact mice, however, sensitivity to cold is genetically correlated with sensitivity to heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We stress that failure to find a significant correlation between gene regulation and pain phenotype in the other four transcripts tested using in situ hybridization does not mean that the corresponding genes, or their regulation following nerve injury, is not important for pain phenotype. Each of these genes may well play an essential role in pain physiology. However, the result indicates that their degree of regulation does not contribute much to across strain variability, at least in the five strains examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite impressive progress in recent years it remains challenging to identify genes whose expression contributes to a predefined functional endpoint such as pain behavior. Correlational analysis is a means of facilitating such identification. Correlational analysis of genes already known to be related to pain provided evidence that in the case of <italic>Scn11a </italic>and <italic>Trpm8</italic>, differential regulation following nerve injury plays a role in phenotypic variability across strains. Applied in a large scale format to data obtained from expression microarrays correlational analysis yielded an entire look-up table of genes whose regulation likely contributes to variability in pain phenotype. As such, many of the genes on the list probably play a significant role in the physiology of neuropathic pain. In principle, the approach used can be applied to any relevant source of biological data, and corresponding phenotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>We used young adult males (8&#x02013;19 weeks of age) of five different inbred mouse strains obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The strain were: AKR/J (AKR), CBA/J (CBA), C3H/HeJ (C3H), C57BL/6J (B6 or C57) and C58/J (C58). Experiments were carried out at two different venues, the Karolinska Institutet (KI, Stockholm) and Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmBH (S-A, Frankfurt). Both before and after experimental surgery mice were maintained in groups in transparent plastic cages bedded with wood shavings (Lantm&#x000e4;nnen, Kimstad, Sweden at KI) or Lignocel HBK 1500/3000 (JRS, Resenberg, Germany at S-A). Water and food pellets (RM3 pellets, Special Diets Services, Witham, UK at KI; product R/M-H 10 mm, Ssniff, Soest, Germany at S-A) were available <italic>ad libitum</italic>. At both venues the light:dark cycle was 12:12 with lights on at 06:00 AM. All procedures were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of KI or in accordance the German Animal Protection Law as overseen by the local Ethics Committee for Research on Laboratory Animals at S-A.</p><p>Experiments were based on the SNL model of neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] with slight modifications. For in situ hybridization analysis (KI) we used a total of 40 mice, 8 from each of the five strains. For each strain 6 mice were sacrificed 3 dpo and 2 were intact controls. For TaqMan and microarray analysis (S-A) we used a total of 144 mice. Observations were made at two postoperative time points, 1 dpo for C58 and C3H mice and 3 dpo for all five strains. In each group 10 mice underwent SNL surgery and 8 mice underwent sham surgery. An additional group of 18 B6 mice (10 SNL and 8 sham) were used for "step 1" TaqMan pilot observations (see below). In all five strains measurements of tactile and heat allodynia in the SNL model of neuropathic pain, and of spontaneous pain in the neuroma model of neuropathic pain, were based on our observations on other individuals of these same strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The reason is that we wanted to track pain behavior in the strains beyond 3 dpo. However, in three stains we made behavioral measurements of tactile allodynia 2 dpo on the actual, individual mice that were sacrificed on the following day for use in the microarray analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized with 350 mg/kg i.p. chloral hydrate (KI) or 1.5&#x02013;3% isoflurane in a 1:2 mixture of O2 and N2O (S-A). Lower back skin was shaved and wiped with 70% ethanol. Using sterilized instruments an incision was made through the skin and the paraspinal muscles were separated from the spinous processes at the L5-L6 levels. The L6 transverse process was then removed exposing the L5 spinal nerve. Finally, the spinal nerve was transected 3&#x02013;5 mm distal to the ganglion, without ligation, and a 3&#x02013;4 mm segment was removed from the distal nerve stump. Care was taken throughout to avoid damage to the adjacent L4 and L6 nerves. To obviate the risk of severing the wrong spinal nerve, at terminal dissection the nerve identified as L5 was dissected into the lumbosacral plexus to insure that it indeed made a major contribution to the sciatic trunk. Sham operated control mice underwent the identical surgical exposures but nerves were not transected. In all animals muscle and skin incisions were closed in layers using surgical sutures and stainless steel clips (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois, US). Mice were given buprenorphine as post-operative analgesic (0.06 mg/kg subcu., S-A) and following recovery from the anesthetic they were returned to their home cage.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral testing</title><p>We obtained data on tactile allodynia, heat allodynia and spontaneous pain in the neuroma model on independent groups of mice of the same five strains used to assess gene regulation. Methods and results were reported previously, with key values presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Briefly, SNL surgery was carried out as described above. Tactile allodynia was assessed using von Frey monofilaments and heat allodynia was assessed by measuring withdrawal latency to a light beam projected from below onto the plantar hindpaw. Autotomy, the behavioral endpoint in the neuroma model of spontaneous neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], was scored at weekly intervals for 5 weeks following transection of the sciatic and saphenous nerves. The scoring protocol was according to Wall et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Briefly, one point was registered for loss of one or more toe nails and an additional point was scored for injury to the distal and the proximal half of each toe for a total maximal score of 11. For calculation of the Spearman rank correlation statistic (r<sub>s</sub>) behavioral scores were converted to strain ranks (1 to 5) where 1 represents the strain with the least nerve injury-induced behavioral change and 5 represents the strain with the largest change.</p><p>In addition, in the AKR, B6 and CBA strains, we obtained behavioral data on tactile allodynia from the individual mice used for the array analysis. Two days after SNL surgery the mice were placed separately in a 10 &#x000d7; 10 cm enclosure. Animals were habituated to the test environment for at least 30 minutes and then cutaneous sensitivity of the lateral plantar aspect of the hind paw was determined using the automated dynamic plantar aesthesiometer (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). In this apparatus a metal filament 0.5 mm in diameter automatically rises from below the wire grid floor and applies a force that increases linearly from 0 to 5 g in 10s. The force that elicited paw withdrawal by the mouse, registered automatically by the apparatus, was taken as the animal's response threshold for a given trial. Each paw was tested four times over a period of 90&#x02013;120 min with at least 30 min rest between tests. Tactile (hyper) sensitivity was defined as the average of the four measurements. For correlational analysis, the degree of tactile allodynia was calculated as the natural logarithm (ln) of threshold measurements for (SNL contralateral paw/SNL ipsilateral paw) - ln (mean of sham group contralateral paw/mean of sham group ipsilateral paw).</p></sec><sec><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>Three days postoperative mice were deeply anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 20 mL Tyrode's solution. Identification of the L5 spinal nerve and DRG was confirmed by a carbon mark left during surgery. DRGs L4 and L5 were quickly dissected out, snap frozen on dry ice and stored at -70&#x000b0;C for up to 6 days until sectioning. For operated mice DRGs were taken from the side of the SNL injury while for intact controls they were taken from either side. DRGs of a given level from operated and control animals of each strain were embedded side by side. Further, DRG pairs of this sort from all five strains were embedded together in single blocks for simultaneous processing using Tissue-Tek&#x02122; OCT compound (Sakura, Zoeterwounde, Netherlands). Blocks, each containing 10 DRGs, were cryo-sectioned at 12 &#x003bc;m and thaw-mounted onto Super Frost/Plus slides (Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany). This multiple embedding protocol ensured that sets of experimental and control ganglia from each mouse strain were processed in parallel under identical conditions.</p><p>Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized complementary to the mouse mRNA sequences of the Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1;-subunit Na<sub>v </sub>1.8 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_009134">NM_009134</ext-link>], (base 2980&#x02013;3021), the Na<sup>+ </sup>channel &#x003b1;-subunit Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_011887">NM_011887</ext-link>], (base 3429&#x02013;3470), the ATP receptor P2X<sub>3 </sub>[GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_145526">NM_145526</ext-link>], (base 1123&#x02013;1164), the heat- and capsaicin-sensitive receptor TRPV1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001001445">NM_001001445</ext-link>], (base 531&#x02013;572), the noxious cold-sensitive receptor TRPA1 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_177781">NM_177781</ext-link>], (base 739&#x02013;780) and the cooling- and menthol-sensitive receptor TRPM8 [GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_134252">NM_134252</ext-link>], (base 809&#x02013;850); Cybergene, Huddinge, Sweden).

Only genes that were expressed above this level were included in the correlation analysis. Means are given &#x000b1; the standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec><title>Correlational analysis</title><sec><title>In situ hybridization data</title><p>For each target gene the proportion of mRNA-positive neuronal profiles in the 4 DRGs from naive mice and the 4&#x02013;6 DRGs from nerve injured mice was calculated. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the significance of changes for each gene by comparing proportions in the na&#x000ef;ve and operated mice (Statistica, StatSoft Scandinavia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). In addition, values from the individual naive mice were averaged to yield a baseline expression level for each gene in each strain (mean percent &#x000b1; SEM). Change in expression of a given transcript for each nerve injured mouse was calculated by subtracting the mouse's individual expression value from the mean of the na&#x000ef;ve mice in the same strain. The values for change in expression were then averaged for each strain and compared across strains using one-way ANOVA. Average change in expression values for all replicate pairs in each of the five strain were converted to ranks (1 to 5) where 1 represents the strain with the smallest magnitude of down-regulation in expression and 5 represents the strain with the largest. Finally, strain average values for regulation were plotted against the strain-specific score for pain sensibility to yield Pearson (parametric) and Spearman (rank) correlation coefficients (r<sub>P </sub>and r<sub>S </sub>; n = 5 data points per plot).</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray data &#x02013; Mouse strains based analysis</title><p>For each of the five strains L5 nerve injury-induced change in expression for each gene (fold up- or down-regulated) in the L5 and the L4DRGs was calculated. The calculation, log of the ratio of SNL vs. sham expression based on intensity values merged over all animals in each strain, was implemented by the corresponding algorithm in Resolver v5.1. Only transcripts with fold regulation &#x02265; 1.5 in at least three strains, or &#x02265; 2 in at least one strain were included for further analysis. Overall, 3927 transcripts met this criterion (3 dpo). For these transcripts, gene expression data for all individuals in each of the five mouse strains was averaged, and the result plotted against strain-specific pain phenotype and r<sub>P </sub>and r<sub>S </sub>were calculated (n = 5 data points per plot). Plots were also made using raw signal intensities from DRGs of operated mice. Pain phenotype was based on the values given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Microarray data &#x02013; Individual mouse analysis</title><p>This analysis was carried out for the three strains in which we assessed tactile allodynia in individual mice (AKR, B6 and CBA). Rather than averaging over all SNL operated animals in a given strain, fold regulation of gene expression in the ipsilateral L5 and L4 DRGs was calculated for each DRG, in each individual mouse, in each strain. Specifically, we calculated the log of the ratio of expression intensity in individual SNL operated DRGs vs. the average expression intensity for the corresponding DRGs in the sham operated mice of the same strain (Resolver v5.1). Genes with fold regulation &#x02265; 1.5 in at least 60% of all SNL operated mice in the three strains, or &#x02265; 2 in at least 20% of these mice, were used for correlational analysis. 3963 transcripts met this criterion. Data on the expression of individual genes in each mouse were plotted against the behavioral results of the individual mice and r<sub>p </sub>was calculated (n = 26 data points per plot). Plots were also made using raw signal intensities from DRGs of operated mice.</p><p>Statistical formalism calls for p-values associated with calculated correlation coefficients r<sub>p </sub>and r<sub>s </sub>to be corrected for multiple testing. As in microarray expression analyses the very large number of comparisons made undermines the ability to declare any given comparison statistically significant. However, the list of genes with high r<sub>p </sub>and r<sub>s </sub>is nonetheless expected to be enriched in candidates whose regulation is related to pain phenotype. The evaluation of enrichment can be enhanced by considering false discovery rates (FDRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. FDR analysis considers the distribution of r-values and asks whether the number of high values exceeds that expected at random. It then assigns a q-value which indicates the expected number of false discoveries in the set of genes with large r values. The absolute value of r<sub>P </sub>was used in the FDR analysis. Computations were done in the R environment using the packages "stats" and "fdrtool" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A value of q &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be significant. Lists of correlated genes were further analyzed according to functional category, both raw categorical distributions and enrichment with respect to the entire mouse genome, using the Gene Ontology Tree Machine (GOTM, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Some of the authors are employees of the commercial firm Sanofi-Aventis.
