Our aim was to identify genetic factors associated with GORD.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods:</title><p>Four separate patient cohorts were analysed using a step-wise approach. (1) Whole genome linkage analysis was performed in 36 families. (2) Candidate genes were tested for GORD association in a trio cohort. (3) Genetic association was replicated in a case&#x02013;control cohort. We also investigated genetic association to hiatus hernia (HH). (4) Protein expression was analysed in oesophageal biopsies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A region on chromosome 2, containing collagen type III alpha 1 (COL3A1), was identified (LOD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3.3) in families with dominant transmission of GORD, stratified for hiatus hernia (HH). COL3A1 showed significant association with GORD in an independent paediatric trio cohort (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003). The association was male specific (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.018). The COL3A1 association was replicated in an independent adult case control cohort (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022). Moreover, male specific association to HH (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.019) was found for a SNP not associated to GORD. Collagen type III protein was more abundant in oesophageal biopsies from male patients with GORD (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>COL3A1 is a disease-associated gene in both paediatric and adult GORD. Furthermore, we show that COL3A1 is genetically associated with HH in adult males. The GORD- and HH-associated alleles are different, indicating two separate mechanisms leading to disease. Our data provides new insight into GORD aetiology, identifying a connective tissue component and indicating a tissue remodelling mechanism in GORD. Our results implicate gender differences in the genetic risk for both for GORD and HH.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is characterised by a retrograde movement of stomach contents into the oesophagus, leading to symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> In severe cases, the disease causes tissue erosion and inflammation in the oesophageal mucosal lining.

To address this, four separate patient cohorts were examined in a step-wise manner. First, genome-wide linkage analysis was carried out in families displaying an apparently dominant inheritance of the disease. Next, gene association analyses were performed in a paediatric trio cohort, followed by replication of results in an adult case&#x02013;control cohort. Lastly, protein levels were examined in oesophageal biopsies from adult patients and healthy controls.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient collections</title><p>Informed consent was obtained before enrolment.

In males, we identified an associated haplotype in COL3A1 (p<sub>corr</sub> of 0.00009; <xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t02">table 2</xref>) and an associated SNP (rs6434304) with a p<sub>corr</sub> (p value adjusted for multiple testing) of 0.02 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>) .

GORD and HH co-existed in 98 individuals. We used the same set of COL3A1 SNPs as previously, and were able to replicate the GORD association at a p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>).

To investigate if COL3A1 also was associated with HH, we stratified the case&#x02013;control cohort for this phenotype and repeated the analysis. Significant association was identified in COL3A1. Interestingly, this was also male specific, with the most significant SNP (rs3134646) showing a p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.019 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>).

Patients had a significantly larger surface area staining than controls (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.038 from 30 cases and eight controls. Thus, the data shows that collagen type III is upregulated in the epithelial lining of the oesophagus as a consequence of GORD. After gender stratification, the up regulation remained significant in males only (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.033, 18 cases and 4four controls).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, based on four independent GORD patient collections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t01">table 1</xref>), we show that COL3A1 is associated with GORD and implicated as being a risk factor for hiatus hernia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>). We identified linkage to the COL3A1 region in a set of families in which GORD and hiatus hernia is transmitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gut-58-08-1063-f01">fig 1</xref>). We show genetic association for COL3A1 to GORD in a paediatric Trio cohort and replicate the genetic association in an adult GORD case control cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t02"/><xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">tables 2 and 3</xref>). We also show genetic association between COL3A1 and hiatus hernia in the same adult case control cohort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>). Our genetic findings from these three independent patient materials are further strengthened by the protein studies from a fourth patient material, where the COL3A1 protein is up regulated in oesophageal tissue biopsies taken from GORD patients in comparison to healthy controls. We show that COL3A1 is associated to both GORD and HH but with different alleles. This becomes even clearer when comparing gender distribution where only males contribute to the HH association (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>).</p><p>The gene COL3A1 encodes type III collagen, a fibrillar mono-trimeric extra cellular matrix protein that is present in extensible connective tissues such as skin, lung, and the vascular system, frequently together with type I collagen. Collagen type III has an important role in adjusting the strength and flexibility of tissues where it is expressed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> Furthermore, COL3A1 is modulated in the wound response process. It is acutely upregulated in the early phases of wound healing and maintains high levels of expression for several weeks after injury. As healing progresses, collagen type III is replaced by collagen type I, leading to increased tissue strength.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref></p><p>A number of COL3A1 mutations cause Ehlers&#x02013;Danlos syndromes type III (EDS-III) and type IV (EDS-IV), both being autosomal dominant connective tissue disorders. Depending on the individual COL3A1 mutation, the severity of these diseases can vary from mild to life threatening. Symptoms include dermal manifestations, joint hyper-mobility and, in severe cases, spontaneous rupture of the bowel or large arteries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> COL3A1 mutations similar to those underlying EDS are unlikely to be disease-causative in patients with GORD due to the milder phenotypic expression seen in GORD compared with EDS. One would rather expect mutations resulting in more subtle effects on gene function.</p><p>The genetic associations we see for haplotypes using the assayed SNPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t02">table 2</xref>) are much stronger than the genetic association seen for single SNPs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-58-08-1063-t03">table 3</xref>). We conclude that none of the SNPs used in this study are causative but rather in linkage disequilibrium with the different disease alleles. We investigated the presence of causative mutations by sequencing the COL3A1 gene in 48 patients from the trio cohort. No disease-associated mutation, apart from the SNPs assayed, could be identified. Our interpretation is that the disease-causative mutations reside in regulatory sequences.</p><p>In our genetic analysis we identify several gender differences in the COL3A1 associations, both for GORD and HH. In the paediatric Trio cohort, only males showed association with GORD. In the adult case&#x02013;control cohort, COL3A1 was associated with GORD without a gender bias, whereas only males showed association with HH. Finally, elevated collagen type III protein staining of the oesophageal biopsies from GORD patients was only found to be significant in males.</p><p>These differences can be attributed to differences between our materials such as: age, population origin, gender composition and disease definition. In fact, COL3A1 itself, is partly regulated by oestrogen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> This is also shown by a the decline of collagen type III expression in post-menopausal women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> Additionally, a gender difference in collagen deposition during wound healing has been reported in disease models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> Furthermore, male gender and increasing age has been shown to be a risk factor for elevated wound healing times.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> Hence, the differences in association we observe in our analyses may be a consequence of the biological regulation of collagen type III.</p><p>From the data we have generated in the extended Kalixanda cohort it is clear that two different mechanisms are at work in COL3A1. One allele is associated with GORD while another allele confers male susceptibility to HH. The SNP that shows the strongest association with GORD (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02) shows absolutely no evidence for association with HH (p<sub>corr</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.94). In this study we have an overlap of 98 patients where both GORD and HH are present. When testing if the male HH-associated SNP is also associated to GORD in males, the association is further weakened, underlining that there are two separate disease alleles for GORD and HH.</p><p>We hypothesise that an altered collagen type III expression in the oesophagus might lead to altered oesophageal tissue strength and flexibility, making the oesophageal lining prone to mucosal damage and wounds. Attenuated COL3A1 function may impair wound healing in the oesophagus. Mutations in COL3A1 have been shown to delay the wound healing response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> An altered collagen type III expression could also contribute to an increased risk for developing HH. An altered collagen I/III ratio has been discussed in conjunction with HH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> Hiatus hernia might be a risk factor for developing GORD through a mechanism involving increased distensibility of the oesophagogastric junction, resulting in GORD as a secondary event.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> Moreover, HH formation may lead to delayed gastric emptying, increasing the clearance time for acid refluxes in the oesophagus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> We suggest that that the associated alleles of COL3A1 are conferring increased susceptibility to both GORD and HH, respectively.</p><p>We welcome a replication of our results from other groups to verify our findings of COL3A1 and, hopefully, identification of the causative mutations. We also raise the question whether there are differences in the wound healing response in controls versus individuals with HH due to an altered collagen I/III ratio.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to all the patients with GORD and their relatives for participating in this study.
