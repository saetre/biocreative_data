However, the antiviral mechanism of action of tetherin has not been determined. Both ends of the tetherin molecule are associated with the plasma membrane and it forms a homodimer. Therefore, a model in which progeny virions are retained on the cell surface by dimer formation between tetherin molecules on the viral envelope and plasma membrane has been proposed as the antiviral mechanism of action of this molecule. To investigate this possibility, we examined the correlation between dimerization and antiviral activity of tetherin in Lassa and Marburg virus-like particle production systems using tetherin mutants deficient in dimer formation. However, the tetherin mutant with complete loss of dimerization activity still showed apparent antiviral activity, indicating that dimerization of tetherin is not essential for its antiviral activity. This suggests that tetherin retains progeny virions on the cell surface by a mechanism other than dimerization.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tetherin (also known as BST2, CD317, or HM1.24) is a cellular factor identified as HIV-1 release inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Neil1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Three cysteine residues in the extracellular domain, C53, C63, and C91, are conserved among human, rhesus monkey, rat, and mouse, while two cysteine residues in the intracellular domain, C9 and C20, are conserved only between human and rhesus monkey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Kupzig1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Ohtomo1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. It is very likely that disulfide bond formation by these cysteine residues is involved in dimerization of tetherin. To examine whether the dimerization of tetherin is important for its antiviral activity, we first generated tetherin mutants with cysteine to alanine substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) and analyzed the effects of exogenous expression of these mutants on release of Lassa Z-induced VLP. The Lassa Z expression plasmid was cotransfected into COS-7 cells with the expression plasmid for wild-type (WT) or mutant tetherin. As expected, WT tetherin was detected as a dimer of around 50 kDa under nonreducing conditions and as triplet bands of monomer of around 20&#x02013;25 kDa under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Single and double substitutions at C9, C20, C53, C63, and C91 had little effect on dimer formation of tetherin (data not shown for single mutants). In the C53/63/91A mutant in which all three cysteine residues in the extracellular domain were replaced with alanine, dimer formation was partially disrupted. The dimerization of tetherin was almost completely abolished in the C9/20/53/63/91A mutant in which all five cysteine residues were substituted with alanine, indicating that these cysteine residues are involved in dimer formation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g001">Figures 1B and C</xref>, the tetherin mutants with double substitutions inhibited the production of Lassa Z-induced VLP to a similar level as WT tetherin. Moreover, the C53/63/91A, which showed reduced dimerization, and the C9/20/53/63/91A, which was almost completely disrupted dimerization, still inhibited Lassa VLP production despite the possibility that the introduction of alanine mutations into multiple cysteine residues may also disrupt the tertiary structure of tetherin. We also analyzed dose-dependent reductions of VLP release at increasing expression levels of WT and mutants of tetherin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g002">Figure 2</xref>, dose-dependent reductions of VLP release were observed in cells expressing WT and mutants of tetherin. The C53/63A mutant showed similar activity to WT in the inhibition of VLP release, while the C53/63/91A and C9/20/53/63/91A mutants showed a little reduced activity. This is consistent with the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>. Although the level of dimerization of the C9/20/53/63/91A mutant is significantly different from that of the C53/63/91A mutant, inhibitory activities of these mutants on VLP release were very similar. Therefore, the reduced inhibitory activities of C53/63/91A and C9/20/53/63/91A mutants may be because the tertiary structure of tetherin was affected by the cysteine to alanine mutations at multiple sites, but not due to loss of dimerization activity of tetherin. Thus, these results indicated that dimerization by intermolecular disulfide bonds is not essential for the antiviral activity of tetherin.</p><fig id="pone-0006934-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006934.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Correlation between dimerization and antiviral activity of tetherin.</title><p>(A) Human tetherin has two cysteine residues in the N-terminal intracellular domain, C9 and C20, and three cysteine residues in the extracellular domain, C53, C63, and C91.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g005">Figure 5A&#x02013;F</xref>, there are several possible models. Models A and B, which require dimerization of tetherin for its antiviral function, were proposed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Gttlinger1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these models appear not to be major mechanisms involved in the antiviral function of tetherin, as our findings showed that dimerization of tetherin is not essential for its antiviral activity. Neil <italic>et al</italic>. reported that truncation of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region or removal of the C-terminal GPI anchor completely abolished the antiviral activity of tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Neil1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also confirmed that the tetherin mutant without the GPI anchor showed complete loss of the antiviral activity (data not shown). In Model C, tetherin retains virions on the cell surface by dimerization between tetherin monomers on apposing cellular and viral membranes, even though tetherin does not have a GPI anchor. This model is incorrect as C-terminal GPI modification of tetherin is essential for its antiviral activity. In contrast, in Model D, the GPI anchor is essential for retention of virions independent of dimer formation of tetherin. Thus, Model D, but not Models A, B, or C, is the most likely, if tetherin solely retains virions on the cell surface.</p><fig id="pone-0006934-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006934.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Proposed models for antiviral mechanism of action of tetherin.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006934.g005"/></fig><p>As shown in Model E, tetherin may retain virions by interaction with other cellular or viral components on the cell membrane or viral envelope.

However, cell surface retention of virions by this interaction with viral GP appears not to be the antiviral mechanism of action of tetherin, as tetherin can also retain VLP induced by only VP40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Sakuma1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Kaletsky1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. VP40 is viral matrix protein present inside the virion and is not presented outside the viral envelope. Therefore, it is unlikely that tetherin interacts directly with VP40 on the cell surface. This is also supported by the observation that colocalization of tetherin and Ebola VP40 or Lassa Z is only partial or not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006934-g004">Figure 4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Kaletsky1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Tetherin on the viral envelope or cell membrane would interact with cellular factors on the cell membrane or viral envelope, respectively.

Both reduced and nonreduced cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006934-Sakuma1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Native PAGE</title><p>COS-7 cells were transfected with 0.8 &#x000b5;g of the expression plasmid for WT or mutant tetherin.
