The gene mutated in BS, <italic>BLM</italic>, encodes a 159 kDa protein that belongs to the RecQ family of DNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c2">2</xref>). This highly conserved family of proteins includes <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c3">3</xref>), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Sgs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c4">4</xref>), <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Rqh1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c5">5</xref>) and at least four human homologues: <italic>RECQL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c6">6</xref>); <italic>WRN</italic>, the gene mutated in the premature aging disorder Werner&#x02019;s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c7">7</xref>); <italic>RECQL4</italic>, the gene mutated in Rothmund&#x02013;Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c8">8</xref>); and <italic>RECQL5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c9">9</xref>). Somatic cells derived from BS patients exhibit excessive numbers of chromosome breaks and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c10">10</xref>). Consistent with this, mutations in the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic><italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>S.pombe</italic><italic>rqh1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes produce phenotypes that resemble those observed in cells derived from BS patients: inactivation of Sgs1p results in an increase in DNA recombination and enhanced chromosome mis-segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c11">11</xref>), while rqh1p deficiency correlates with hypersensitivity to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c5">5</xref>). Further evidence of a role for the RecQ family of helicases in homologous recombination comes from the observations that RecQ, Sgs1p, BLM and WRN all disrupt four-way junctions, a structural mimic of the Holliday junction intermediate formed as a consequence of DNA strand exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c15">15</xref>). In addition, both BLM and WRN can promote branch migration of Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c15">15</xref>). Last but not least, it was recently shown that Sgs1p contributes to the suppression of both gross chromosomal rearrangements and recombination between divergent DNA sequences in a pathway that is redundant with MMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c16">16</xref>).</p><p> BLM has been shown to form complexes with replication protein A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c17">17</xref>), topoisomerase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c18">18</xref>) and RAD51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c19">19</xref>), suggesting a role for BLM during replication and recombination. Moreover, the recent identification of BLM as part of the <underline>B</underline>RCA1-<underline>a</underline>ssociated genome <underline>s</underline>urveillance <underline>c</underline>omplex (BASC) links BLM with a number of tumour suppressor and DNA damage repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c20">20</xref>). The BASC complex includes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, ATM, BLM, the RAD50&#x02013;MRE11&#x02013;NBS1 complex and replication factor C. Many components of this complex have roles in recognition and signalling of DNA damage and unusual DNA structures, suggesting that BASC might play the role of &#x02018;damage sensor&#x02019;.</p><p> The hypermutability of BS cells is very likely the cause of the cancer predisposition in persons with BS. However, the molecular basis of the genomic instability in BS is poorly understood. To obtain further insight into the biological processes in which BLM is involved, we performed a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) screen to identify proteins that interact with BLM. We now report that BLM directly interacts with hMLH1, the human homologue of the <italic>E.coli</italic> MutL protein, known to be involved in MMR and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of plasmids</title><p>Various deletion mutants of BLM and hMLH1 were constructed by PCR and restriction digests starting from the vectors pJK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c24">24</xref>) and pFastBacI-hMLH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c25">25</xref>) containing the&#x000a0;cDNAs of BLM and hMLH1, respectively, and cloned into the YTH vectors pBTM116, pACT2 and pGAD424.

Thirteen independent clones specifically interacting with the bait were isolated from a random-primed human peripheral blood cDNA library, among which a truncation (amino acids 198&#x02013;756) of the human MMR protein MLH1 was found. The specificity of this interaction was also confirmed with full-length hMLH1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;756) and by switching the hybrid partners: a fusion of hMLH1 to the LexA DNA-binding domain (LexAdbd) interacted with full-length BLM fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4ad) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f1">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Sgs1p, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> RecQ homologue, interacts with yMlh1p</title><p>Since both RecQ helicases and MLH1 have been conserved throughout evolution, and given that RecQ helicase mutants in yeast and humans affect genomic stability, we asked whether Sgs1p, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homologue of BLM, interacts with yeast Mlh1p (yMlh1p) in the two-hybrid system. Although the C-terminal domains of Sgs1p and BLM share little sequence homology, the C-terminal domain (amino acids 784&#x02013;1447) of Sgs1p was found to specifically interact with yMlh1p. Analogous to the BLM&#x02013;hMLH1 interaction, the YTH interaction between Sgs1p and yMlh1p was confirmed for full-length yMlh1p and Sgs1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f1">1</xref>C).</p><p> Different studies have shown that expression of the <italic>BLM</italic> gene can partially complement both the hyper-recombination phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c31">31</xref>) and the reduced lifespan of <italic>sgs1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c32">32</xref>). We wondered whether there is an interspecies interaction between BLM and MLH1, i.e. whether Sgs1p interacts with hMlh1p and BLM with yMlh1p. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f1">1</xref>C, we were able to detect an interspecies interaction via YTH between Sgs1p (amino acids 784&#x02013;1447) and hMLH1 as well as between yMlh1 and BLM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f1">1</xref>C). The result was also confirmed for full-length Sgs1p after switching the hybrid partners (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>BLM and hMLH1 exist as a complex in human cells</title><p>Given that BLM and hMLH1 interact in the YTH assay, we wanted to test if BLM forms a complex with hMLH1 in human cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed, where an anti-MLH1 monoclonal antibody was used to precipitate its cognate protein from human nuclear cell extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f2">2</xref>A). BLM could be immunoprecipitated with hMLH1 from extracts of the MMR-proficient TK6 cells (lane 4), but not from extracts of hMLH1-deficient HCT116 cells (lane 3). In addition, the inverse co-immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out, in which an anti-BLM polyclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate hMLH1 from nuclear extracts of the human BJAB cell line. As seen in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f2">2</xref>B, hMLH1 could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with anti-BLM (lane 3), but not with the control IgG antibody (lane 2).</p></sec><sec><title>BLM and hMLH1 interact directly <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We next wanted to determine whether the interaction between BLM and hMLH1 was direct, rather than being mediated via an accessory protein. Far western analysis was therefore performed to determine whether purified recombinant BLM and hMLH1 could interact directly <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, full-length recombinant BLM protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c24">24</xref>) was immobilised on a nitrocellulose filter, which was then incubated either with purified MutL&#x003b1;, a heterodimer of hMLH1 and hPMS2, or with extracts of Sf9 cells expressing either hMLH1 or hPMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c25">25</xref>). The filter was then washed to remove the unbound proteins and the presence of BLM was detected using conventional western blotting with anti-hMLH1 and&#x0002f;or anti-hPMS2 antibodies. As controls, the membrane also contained BSA and BLM alone. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f3">3</xref> shows that BLM protein could be detected with antibodies against both hMLH1 (lane 2) and hPMS2 (lane 3) after incubation with the purified MutL&#x003b1; complex, but only hMLH1 alone (lane 5), and not hPMS2 (lane 7), could bind to BLM. The interaction between hMLH1 and BLM appeared to be specific, because MutL&#x003b1; and hMLH1 failed to bind the control protein, BSA (lanes 4 and 6), which was loaded on the same blot. To re-confirm these data, the reciprocal far western experiment was carried out, wherein human BLM protein was used to probe nitrocellulose-bound hMLH1. In this experiment, the anti-BLM antibody revealed a specific band at &#x0223c;80 kDa, the position of migration of hMLH1 (lane 12). This band was due to BLM binding to hMLH1, as its position was identical to the specific hMLH1 band detected when purified MutL&#x003b1; complex was probed with anti-hMLH1 antibody (lane 9), and not to the band specific for PMS2 (lane 10). Again, the interaction between BLM and hMLH1 was specific, because no signal was detected with the control BSA protein (lane 11). We conclude that purified recombinant BLM and hMLH1 interact directly <italic>in vitro</italic> and that BLM interaction with PMS2 is mediated via hMLH1.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping of the BLM and hMLH1 interaction domains</title><p>To investigate which region of BLM protein was responsible for mediating the interaction with hMLH1, a series of BLM deletion mutants was generated and tested for their ability to interact with full-length hMLH1 in the YTH assay. As negative controls, the empty vector and a fragment of hMLH1 (amino acids 1&#x02013;388) that did not bind to BLM were included. The results of these experiments indicated the presence of three independent hMLH1-interacting regions in BLM comprising residues 1&#x02013;131, 448&#x02013;572 and 1034&#x02013;1417 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f4">4</xref>A).</p><p> A similar approach was used to map the BLM interaction domain of hMLH1. A series of N- and C-terminal deletions of hMLH1 was generated and tested for interaction with full-length BLM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f4">4</xref>B). The results clearly indicated that the N-terminus of hMLH1 was dispensable for interaction with BLM, while the C-terminus (amino acids 396&#x02013;756), a region similar to that involved in the interaction with hMLH3, hPMS1 and hPMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c33">33</xref>), was essential. A deletion of as little as 60&#x000a0;amino acids from the C-terminus of hMLH1 was sufficient to destroy the interaction with BLM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f4">4</xref>B).</p><p> In addition, the YTH interaction domain mapping of both proteins was further confirmed using an <italic>in vitro</italic> binding approach, in which one of the interacting proteins was immobilised on a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with several <sup>35</sup>S-labelled <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated deletion mutants of the other protein. Different <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and translated BLM fragments were incubated with membrane-bound purified recombinant MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer and BSA, included as a negative control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f4">4</xref>C). The weak binding of the BLM fragments might be due to the low accessibility of hMLH1 due to its heterodimerisation with hPMS2. Nevertheless, all the fragments containing one of the three domains identified in the YTH screen were able to bind to MutL&#x003b1;, but not to BSA, thus confirming the YTH mapping. Moreover, we could further narrow down the C-terminal interacting domain to a region between amino acids 1109 and 1378, as both C-terminal fragments tested clearly interacted with MutL&#x003b1;. <italic>In vitro</italic> transcribed and translated full-length hMLH1 as well as different deletions thereof were incubated with immobilised purified recombinant BLM and BSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f4">4</xref>D). While the N-terminal half of the protein did not interact with BLM, the C-terminal half bound to BLM as strongly as the full-length protein. This interaction was completely abolished when the C-terminal half was further divided. Additionally, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed and&#x000a0;translated hMLH1 was shown to bind to immobilised N-terminally truncated purified BLM protein (amino acids 212&#x02013;1417; data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>BLM and hMLH1 co-localise in the nucleus</title><p>The co-immunoprecipitation of BLM and hMLH1 from human cell extracts, as well as the evidence of a direct interaction between BLM and hMLH1, is consistent with these proteins forming a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. To provide additional evidence for the existence of this interaction, we wanted to see whether BLM and hMLH1 co-localise within the nucleus of intact human cells. Indirect immunofluorescence of exponentially growing human WI-38&#x0002f;VA-13 cells, using either anti-BLM or anti-hMLH1 antibodies, revealed BLM and hMLH1 to localise to prominent nuclear foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f5">5</xref>). Merging the fluorescent signals for BLM and hMLH1 showed a clear concordance in their localisation, thus strengthening the notion that the two proteins may function in a common biochemical pathway. A similar co-localisation pattern was obtained following aphidicolin treatment of the cells (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>BS cell lines are MMR proficient</title><p>No DNA helicase activities have so far been found to be associated with the MMR process. To address the question whether BLM is acting together with hMLH1 in MMR, the MMR proficiency of extracts of two lymphoblastoid (GM03403 and GM09960) and one fibroblast (GM08505) cell lines derived from BS patients were analysed. The absence of BLM protein in nuclear extracts of the BS cell lines was confirmed by western blot analysis, using antibodies raised against both the N- and C-termini of BLM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f6">6</xref>A and data not shown). Extracts derived from the lymphoblastoid TK6 and fibroblastoid MRC5 cells, HCT116 cells, and PSNF5 cells (GM08505 containing the BLM cDNA) were used as controls. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f6">6</xref>B, all BS-derived nuclear extracts were MMR proficient using a substrate containing a single G&#x000b7;T mismatch and a strand discrimination signal (a nick) upstream (5&#x02032;) from the mispair. The lower repair efficiency of the nuclear extract derived from the two lymphoblastoid cell lines GM03403 and GM09960, as compared to the MMR-proficient TK6 cells, is due to their high genomic instability and consequently to their reduced viability. Addition of recombinant purified BLM to the GM03403 or GM09960 cell extracts failed to influence the efficiency of MMR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke583f6">6</xref>B), which implies that the extracts had an intrinsically lower MMR capacity rather than being MMR deficient due to lack of BLM. Similar results were obtained using cytoplasmic extracts of the BLM cell lines and a template with the nick downstream (3&#x02032;) from the mismatch (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Defects in the BLM gene product result in severe physiological consequences in humans, the most prominent of which is premature death due to cancer. Although a great deal of genetic and biochemical data are available on BLM, the molecular defects resulting in BS remain elusive. In this study, we performed a YTH screen using the C-terminal portion of BLM as bait and a human peripheral blood cDNA library as a source of potential partners. One of the isolated BLM-interacting factors was hMLH1, a protein known to be involved in MMR and recombination. We now present several lines of evidence that BLM interacts directly with hMLH1 via three separate sites on BLM. Deletion of these three sites located in the N-terminal, central and C-terminal domains of BLM, was found to completely abolish the ability of BLM to interact with hMLH1. In addition, we have shown that the C-terminal 360 residues of hMLH1 are sufficient to interact with BLM. Furthermore, we have shown that the interaction between BLM and hMLH1 is highly conserved throughout evolution, since Sgs1p, the yeast homologue of BLM, interacts with yMlh1p. We have also shown that this interaction occurs between species: Sgs1p interacted with hMLH1 and BLM interacted with yMlh1p. This evolutionary conservation of an interaction between Sgs1p and yMLH1, together with the interspecies interactions, suggests that these two proteins together perform a fundamentally important role during DNA metabolism.</p><p> What could be the functional significance of the BLM&#x02013;hMLH1 interaction? To address this question, we investigated the role of BLM helicase in mismatch repair. Post-replicative mismatch repair is evolutionarily highly conserved, from <italic>E.coli</italic> to humans, and is postulated to consist of three principal steps: mismatch recognition and assembly of the &#x02018;repairosome&#x02019;, degradation of the error-containing strand, and DNA repair synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c34">34</xref>). This implies the existence of other proteins involved in the steps following mismatch recognition. Some of these proteins have already been characterized and their involvement in MMR has been documented. They include DNA polymerase &#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c35">35</xref>), PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c36">36</xref>), RP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c37">37</xref>) and exonuclease EXOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c38">38</xref>; for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c22">22</xref>). However, some members of the MMR repairosome, such as the putative DNA helicase, remain to be identified.</p><p> Our functional experiments indicate that BLM helicase doesn&#x02019;t play an essential role in MMR, as three different cell extracts form BS cells were shown to be MMR proficient. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the helicase function in MMR is redundant and that the lack of only one helicase might result in a qualitatively &#x02018;normal&#x02019; phenotype.</p><p> The elevated sister chromatid exchange and hyper-recombination associated with BS suggest a defect in recombination. BLM helicase (and other RecQ family helicases) have been proposed to play important roles in overcoming structural abnormalities that arise during replication, thus preventing illegitimate recombination events occurring in regions prone to chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c19">19</xref>). Interestingly, recent findings show that the Msh2, Msh6 and Mlh1&#x02013;Mlh3 proteins bind not only to mismatched DNA, but also to Holliday junctions in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke583c39">39</xref>,40). We therefore suggest that the BLM&#x02013;hMLH1 complex may act as a potential sensor of recombination and replication fork damage. In the light of the available evidence, we are currently investigating the potential role of BLM and Sgs1p in these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF</title><p>Langland <italic>et al.</italic> (41) have also identified an interaction between BLM and hMLH1 protein.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke583f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> YTH interactions.
