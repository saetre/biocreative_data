To investigate the function of CD97 in colorectal carcinogenesis, transgenic Tg(villin-CD97) mice overexpressing CD97 in enterocytes were generated and subjected to azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, we found a CD97 cDNA copy number-dependent reduction of DSS-induced colitis in Tg compared to wild-type (WT) mice that was confirmed by applying a simple DSS protocol. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that overexpression of CD97 strengthened lateral cell-cell contacts between enterocytes, which, in contrast, were weakened in CD97 knockout (Ko) mice. Transepithelial resistance was not altered in Tg and Ko mice, indicating that tight junctions were not affected. In Tg murine and normal human colonic enterocytes as well as in colorectal cell lines CD97 was localized preferentially in E-cadherin-based adherens junctions. CD97 overexpression upregulated membrane-bound but not cytoplasmic or nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin and reduced phospho-&#x003b2;-catenin, labeled for degradation. This was associated with inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) and activation of Akt. In summary, CD97 increases the structural integrity of enterocytic adherens junctions by increasing and stabilizing junctional &#x003b2;-catenin, thereby regulating intestinal epithelial strength and attenuating experimental colitis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intestinal epithelial cells are linked together by a junctional complex comprising tight and adherens junctions and desmosomes, providing different functions in cell-cell adhesion. In adherens junctions (or <italic>zonulae adherentes</italic>), homophilically interacting E-cadherin receptors physically link the confronting cell membranes. At the intracellular membrane face, E-cadherins are connected through intracellular plaque core proteins, mainly catenins, to cortical actin filament bundles, organizing a circular adhesion belt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Niessen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Kam1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. E-cadherin-based adherens junctions contribute crucially to the organization and stabilization of the polarized intestinal cell layer. Their dysregulation causes cell depolarization, loss of contact-dependent inhibition of proliferation, increased motility, leakiness of the mucosal barrier, and disturbances in enterocytic cell-cell contact formation &#x02013; processes that have been linked to colorectal carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Jeanes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref> and inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Bruewer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Additional complications can arise from the dislocation of membrane-bound &#x003b2;-catenin, which functions as a nuclear modulator in Wnt signaling during colorectal carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Kam1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An increasing number of molecules have been described to be engaged in the complex regulation of adherens junctions, a process which is not yet understood in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Abe1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rivard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we report CD97 to be located in enterocytic E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, where it regulates structural integrity by modulating the anchor protein &#x003b2;-catenin. CD97 is a member of the epidermal growth factor seven-span transmembrane (EGF-TM7) family of adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Yona1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Next to its broad and abundant expression in leukocytes, CD97 is found in various normal and malignant epithelia. We previously described its overexpression in colorectal adenocarcinomas compared to the corresponding normal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Steinert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

These CD97 Tg mice were examined in the azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model for colitis-associated tumorigenesis. Unexpectedly, depending on the CD97 cDNA copy number integrated, carcinogenesis in Tg mice was reduced due to impaired DSS-induced injury. Ultrastructural analysis of colonic enterocytes revealed that lateral cell-cell contacts were strengthened in CD97 Tg mice and weakened in CD97 knockout (Ko) mice. We demonstrate that CD97 is located in E-cadherin-based adherens junctions and that it regulates membrane-associated &#x003b2;-catenin associated with alterations in Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2; (GSK-3&#x003b2;) signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This research complied with the ethics guidelines of the University of Leipzig.

Lowest levels of these catenins were seen in Ko mice. Expression of E-cadherin was not affected. &#x003b1;-tubulin was used as a loading control. B Western blot analysis of the membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction of colonic lysates showed an increase only in membrane-associated &#x003b2;-catenin in Tg mice. C Phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin, leading to its degradation, inversely correlated with the amount of CD97 in colonic lysates. Phosphorylation of the kinases GSK-3&#x003b2; and Akt that are involved in the regulation of &#x003b2;-catenin degradation was regulated by CD97 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3"><italic>Results</italic></xref> for details). The same lysates as in (A) were analyzed. A&#x02013;C All experiments were performed in triplicate, typical runs are shown. Colonic lysates of the various mouse lines were always analyzed in one run in parallel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0008507.g006"/></fig><p>Next to the majority of &#x003b2;-catenin that is bound to the intracellular domain of E-cadherin, a cytoplasmic pool exists that is degraded after phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Aberle1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased levels of cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin can accumulate and become available for nuclear translocation and binding to T-cell factor (TCF) DNA-binding proteins, resulting in gene transcription. By extracting membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear proteins, we could show that CD97 overexpression specifically causes accumulation of membrane-associated &#x003b2;-catenin while the amount of cytosolic and nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin was not affected and rather low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008507-g006">fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p>Cellular levels of &#x003b2;-catenin are regulated through phosphorylation by GSK-3&#x003b2; at Ser 33/37 leading to proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Aberle1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, CD97 overexpression decreased phospho-&#x003b2;-catenin in Tg compared to WT mice. Highest levels of p-&#x003b2;-catenin were found in Ko mice, where probably most of the total &#x003b2;-catenin was phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008507-g006">fig. 6c</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin inversely correlated with the amount of CD97, indicating that CD97 stabilizes &#x003b2;-catenin and increases its level in adherens junctions. Our data suggest an inactivation of GSK-3&#x003b2;, which occurs by phosphorylation through different kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Yost1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Srivastava1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, quantitation of phospho-GSK-3&#x003b2; (Ser9) revealed its increase in Tg2 compared to WT mice. Our data further suggest that GSK-3&#x003b2; is inactivated by Akt, known as protein kinase B (PKB), a serine/threonine kinase that is fully activated following its phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rivard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We found an upregulation of total Akt in Tg compared to WT and Ko mice combined with detectable p-Akt (Ser473) in Tg1 and Tg2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008507-g006">fig. 6c</xref>). This result was confirmed by multiimmunoblotting analysis of colonic lysates of CD97 Ko, WT and Tg1 mice: one out of the two proteins exhibiting phosphorylation changes of greater than 300&#x00025; between WT and Tg1 mice was p-Akt (Ser473; signal intensity CD97 Ko: 217, WT: 180; Tg1: 614 arbitrary units). Phosphorylation of Akt at tyrosine 308 was only detectable in Tg1 lysates (signal intensity Tg1: 78 arbitrary units).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We here demonstrate a novel role of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CD97 in regulating intestinal epithelial cell function. By comparing CD97 Tg mice that constitutively overexpress CD97 in intestinal epithelial cells to WT animals and to mice that lack a functional <italic>Cd97</italic> gene, we obtained evidence that CD97 controls the structure of enterocytic adherens junctions and thereby the integrity of the intestinal barrier.</p><p>We first made these observations when subjecting CD97 Tg mice to AOM treatment combined with DSS in order to study the effect of CD97 on tumorigenesis. DSS causes destruction of the epithelial cells in the basal crypts and induce an inflammatory reaction in the colonic mucosa that acts as a promoter of colorectal carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Kitajima1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Neufert1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Unexpectedly, we found a reduction of tumor numbers in Tg mice that was caused by amelioration of DSS-induced injury. Protection of CD97 Tg mice from DSS colitis was reproduced by treatment with DSS alone and involved lower clinical disease activity, less histological crypt damage, and reduced local and systemic immune reactivity.</p><p>The finding that CD97 overexpression attenuated colitis and the fact that this amelioration correlated with the CD97 cDNA copy number integrated in the Tg mice indicated that CD97 can regulate epithelial cell function. Integrity and stability of the intestinal epithelium is maintained by different types of specialized cell contacts. Immunohistochemistry revealed co-localization of CD97 with proteins of E-cadherin-based adherens junctions in murine as well as human colonic enterocytes and colorectal cell lines. In addition, electron microscopy studies showed that these basally localized cell-cell junctions were strengthened in CD97 Tg mice and weakened in CD97 Ko mice.</p><p>The formation and stabilization of adherens junctions requires the recruitment of cytosolic &#x003b2;-catenin to the plasma membrane and its tight association with E-cadherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rivard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. We found evidence that CD97 can regulate the localization and stability of &#x003b2;-catenin in enterocytes. Firstly, CD97 expression levels correlated with the amount of non-phosphorylated, stable &#x003b2;-catenin. Secondly, the amount of p-Akt (Ser473) and p-GSK-3&#x003b2; was regulated consistently and reversely in Ko and Tg compared to WT mice, indicating that Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2; signaling is involved in the stabilization of &#x003b2;-catenin through CD97. Akt phosphorylates the N-terminus of GSK-3&#x003b2; thereby inhibiting the ability of GSK-3&#x003b2; to phosphorylate &#x003b2;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rivard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Because phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin initiates its ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome, phosphorylation of GSK-3&#x003b2; may explain the accumulation of membranous non-phosphorylated &#x003b2;-catenin in Tg enterocytes.</p><p>In tumor cells, a different distribution of &#x003b2;-catenin is found. Here, accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<italic>Apc</italic>) gene, involved in the intracellular transport of &#x003b2;-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Faux1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, or in the genes encoding axin and &#x003b2;-catenin leads to translocation of &#x003b2;-catenin into the nucleus, where it induces genes critical for cell transformation and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Wong1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. It becomes increasingly clear that the junctional, cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of &#x003b2;-catenin are closely connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Kam1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study we identified CD97 to regulate the membrane-associated pool of &#x003b2;-catenin.</p><p>The observations that CD97 overexpression enhances the strength of enterocytic adherens junctions and increases random tumor cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Galle1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> seem to be contradictory. We have evidence that Akt signaling is involved in both the CD97-induced strengthening of adherens junctions and in the migration of tumor cells: specific inhibitors of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PIK3)/Akt pathway stopped CD97-induced random tumor migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Aust1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility of a dual role of CD97 is supported by a recent study demonstrating Akt signaling in E-cadherin-based adherens junction formation as well as in tumor cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rivard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note is the fact that CD97 is not restricted to adherens junctions. Peripheral blood leukocytes bear the molecule evenly distributed at their surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Eichler1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Leemans1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, carcinomas also show intracellular cytoplasmic staining for CD97 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Steinert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Aust2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. In migratory, CD97-overexpressing HT1080 cells, the molecule was located in membrane ruffles at the leading edge, co-localized with cortical F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Aust1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, membrane ruffles of migrating tumor fibroblasts were &#x003b2;-catenin positive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Johnson1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. All these data indicate that CD97 is found in different cellular pools where it might engage with additional molecular processes.</p><p>Adherens junctions crucially contribute to the organization and stabilization of a polarized intestinal epithelium and their dysregulation has been linked causally to inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Ivanov1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;. To our knowledge, the CD97 Tg mouse is the first genetic model, in which adherens junctions are strengthened and intestinal barrier function is augmented. Interestingly, a susceptibility locus for inflammatory bowel disease has been found in close proximity to the EGF-TM7 gene cluster on chromosome 19p13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Rioux1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Mathew1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD97 promotor (T64C) was associated with ulcerative colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008507-Zhang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these findings need further confirmation, they may indicate a role of EGF-TM7 receptors in inflammatory bowel disease. By analyzing colonic biopsies of ulcerative colitis patients, we observed a loss of CD97 from enterocytic adherens junctions in 4 out of 5 patients. Whether this was due to the ongoing disintegration of the tissue or indicates the involvement of CD97 in the disease process remains to be shown.</p><p>In summary, by establishing CD97 Tg mice and examining them in tumor- and colitis-associated models we identified a novel, yet unknown function of the adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor CD97. CD97 regulated plaque core proteins of adherens junctions in colonic enterocytes. CD97 overexpression strengthened these cell contacts, which results in an increased epithelial integrity and decreased experimental colitis sensitivity. Moreover, for the first time key molecules of intracellular signaling via an EGF-TM7 receptor were identified. Our data suggest that CD97 induces Akt/GSK-3&#x003b2; signaling that results in a decrease of proteolytic digestion of &#x003b2;-catenin and its stabilization in adherens junctions. Our data are confirmed by the reverse results obtained in Ko mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank F. Loschke, C. Vogel, and M.
