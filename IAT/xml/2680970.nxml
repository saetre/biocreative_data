We previously described an atypical RTK in the platyhelminth parasite <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, composed of an extracellular Venus flytrap module (VFT) linked through a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain similar to that of the insulin receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Here we show that this receptor is a member of a new family of RTKs found in invertebrates, and particularly in insects. Sixteen new members of this family, named Venus Kinase Receptor (VKR), were identified in many insects. Structural and phylogenetic studies performed on VFT and TK domains showed that VKR sequences formed monophyletic groups, the VFT group being close to that of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and the TK one being close to that of insulin receptors. We show that a recombinant VKR is able to autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, and report that it can be activated by L-arginine. This is in agreement with the high degree of conservation of the alpha amino acid binding residues found in many amino acid binding VFTs. The presence of high levels of <italic>vkr</italic> transcripts in larval forms and in female gonads indicates a putative function of VKR in reproduction and/or development.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The identification of RTKs specific for parasites and insect vectors raises new perspectives for the control of human parasitic and infectious diseases.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are single-pass membrane proteins constituted of an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Yarden1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. RTK-mediated signals play key roles in the regulation of various cellular processes, such as the control of cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and migration. In mammals, a large number of RTKs have been identified and classified into 20 subfamilies that mostly differ by the structural organization of their ligand recognition domain. These include, for examples, the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs or ErbBs), the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), the insulin and the insulin-like growth factor receptors (IR and IGFR), the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) and the proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase ROS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-BlumeJensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The RTK family is even more complex when considering invertebrate receptors. For example <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> genome contains 40 RTKs of which only 13 can be classified in 10 out of the 20 subfamilies of human RTKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Plowman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, several unusual RTKs have been described in <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic>, such as Lemon which is a RTK characterized by the presence of extracellular immunoglobulin-like repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Miller1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, or Sweet Tooth with an extracellular portion containing four C-type lectin-like domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Reidling1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In all cases, these receptors function as oligomers (either constitutive oligomers or ligand-induced oligomers), the activation process involving a precise control of the relative position of the TK domains, leading to their auto-phosphorylation and then, their self activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-BlumeJensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Recently, we reported the identification and characterization of an unexpected atypical RTK in the blood-dwelling fluke platyhelminth <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. This receptor is composed of an extracellular Venus Flytrap module (VFT), usually found in class C G-protein-coupled receptors such as the &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor, linked through a single transmembrane domain to an intracellular tyrosine kinase similar to that of the IR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Vicogne1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. This unusual receptor was called VKR for Venus Kinase Receptor. VFTs are large domains composed of two lobes connected via flexible tethers that close around the bound ligand similarly to the leaves of the Venus Flytrap carnivorous plant, <italic>Dionaea muscipula</italic>, when they catch their preys. VFTs were first identified as bacterial periplasmic-binding proteins (PBP) involved in the transport of small molecules, such as amino acids, sugars or ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-OHara1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. VFTs constitute the binding pocket of different receptor types such as class C G-protein coupled receptors that are activated by amino acids (GABA or glutamate), sugar (the sweet taste receptor) or ions (the calcium sensing receptors), the ionotropic glutamate receptor iGluR, in which it constitutes a binding domain for natural allosteric modulators, and the atrial natriuretic peptide receptors (ANFR) with guanylate cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005651-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Pin1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. All these receptors function as homo- or hetero-oligomers, and the VFTs are directly involved in the oligomeric assembly. They even play an important role in receptor activation through the control of the general oligomeric organization of these receptors, mostly by controling the relative position of the protomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-He1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Pin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0005651-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005651.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>VKR are original proteins composed of a VFTM associated to a TK domain.</title><p>The top panel represents the VFTM found in the bacterian periplasmic binding proteins (PBP) and in eukaryotic cell surface membrane receptors (iGluR: ionotropic Glutamate Receptor; ANFR: Atrial Natriuretic Factor Receptor; mGluR: metabotropic Glutamate Receptor; GABA<sub>B</sub>R: metabotropic &#x003b1;-aminobutyric acid Receptor).

Other residues that bind the primary amine of the glutamate ligand in mGlu1 (Thr188, Asp208, Tyr236 and Asp318) are less conserved in VKRs, but their chemical features are compatible with the binding of the primary groups of amino-acids. These results suggest that the ligands of VKRs could be amino-acids or derivatives.

Using a combination of bioinformatic, molecular biology and biochemical experiments, we demonstrated that the members of this family are single transmembrane-spanning molecules composed of an extracellular VFTM and an intracellular TK domain related to that of IR. At least for <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, the VKR proteins are functional and their kinase activity can be induced by small ligands such as L-Arg.</p><p>The VKR proteins are largely represented in the class of insects, although the first two examples were discovered outside this class, in the trematode <italic>S. mansoni</italic> (the parasite responsible for schistosomiasis, the second most important tropical disease after malaria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-vanderWerf1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Vicogne1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and in the sea urchin <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, and named SmVKR and SpVKR respectively. In 2006, during the inventory of the genes encoding RTK in the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome, two genes Sp-INSR and Sp-ILGFR related to IR family were identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Lapraz1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, and we could recognize that the second one Sp-ILGFR was an RTK homologous to SmVKR. We could notice that gene structure was overall highly conserved in insects with an important restriction of size and of exon numbers when compared to other organisms. Owing to the substantial number of dipteran <italic>vkr</italic> sequences identified, we could demonstrate that gene structures were homogenous in culicidae (mosquitoes) and drosophilidae (flies). Such a gene conservation in dipterans could argue for a potential importance of VKR receptors in insect biology.</p><p>No <italic>vkr</italic> gene could be detected in the lepidopteran genome of <italic>B. mori</italic> and in the the genome of most of the drosophilidae belonging to the <italic>melanogaster</italic> group, despite an extensive and complete analysis of the genome of these flies, suggesting the absence of the <italic>vkr</italic> gene in these insects. In this group, only the <italic>D. ananasse</italic> species was demonstrated to contain a putative <italic>vkr</italic> gene, <italic>Davkr</italic>. Moreover <italic>Davkr</italic> has a genomic structure different from all of the other drosophilidae <italic>vkr</italic> genes with an additional exon in the TK domain that could create an incorrect ATP-binding sequence in the protein and generate an inactive kinase. Such an observation is probably related to the disappearance of <italic>vkr</italic> genes along the evolution of flies inside of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> group. Moreover, for this interpretation, we have to consider that the currently defined <italic>Drosophila</italic> genus has been shown to be paraphyletic, including more than 2 000 species, some but not all of them descending from a common ancestor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Dalton1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Gene mapping and analysis of <italic>vkr</italic> gene environment in the various insects would be helpful for studying evolution of VKR as well as importance in insect biology.</p><p>This homogeneity of the VKR proteins in the phylogenetic analyses of VFT and TK domains suggests the existence of a common ancestral gene and the conservation of functional properties in all of these molecules. Although that no information can be given about the origin of <italic>vkr</italic>, we can postulate that, according to the hypothesis already proposed by Yarden and Ullrich about the evolution of RTK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Yarden1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, an ancestral <italic>vkr</italic> gene would have resulted from the genetic combination of a pre-existing VFTM with a TK domain of a cytoplasmic protein. Until now, <italic>vkr</italic> has never been detected in any vertebrate genome and therefore it can be supposed to be invertebrate specific. However, <italic>vkr</italic> genes have not been found in every invertebrate species and for example are absent from the genome of the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In platyhelminths, VKR has been characterized only in <italic>Schistosoma</italic> species, but in-depth researches in turbellarian genome data bases have allowed the detection in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> of a genomic sequence (GenBank: AAWT01078636.1) encoding a putative TK domain of VKR proteins linked to a truncated VFT module. Further genomic and functional studies are still required to understand both the origin of <italic>vkr</italic> genes and their selective existence/persistence in given invertebrate organisms.</p><p>The VFT domain being close to that of class-C GPCRs in particular GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors and the TK one being close to that of IR, it suggests an original mode of functioning for a RTK. First, we showed that the recombinant AmVKR forms homo- or oligomers, as expected for membrane receptor containing a VFTM such as class-C GPCRs and ANFR that are well-known to function as homo- or hetero-dimers as well as the RTK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-BlumeJensen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-He1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Pin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. All motifs essential for TK activity were perfectly conserved in the TK domain of VKR suggesting that dimerized AmVKR receptors could autophosphorylate and exert kinase activity. Surprisingly, the basal level of auto-phosphorylation is quite low compared to that we could expect for a recombinant IR in the same conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Tavare1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, we need to use constitutively active AmVKR mutants to obtain high levels of kinase activity strongly suggesting that VKR activation in cell signalling was dependent on the binding of a ligand in the extracellular domain of the receptor.</p><p>Although all RTKs are activated by dimerization, different ligands employ different strategies for inducing the active dimeric state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Schlessinger1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although the ligand binding site can be at the VFTM dimeric interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-He1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Ogawa1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, usually ligands bind into the VFTM binding pocket and in Class-C GPCRs binding of the natural ligands induces closure of the VFT responsible for receptor activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Pin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In VFTM VKR binding pocket, we observed a relative conservation of the residue responsible for binding of the alpha-amino acid functions of the glutamate in mGlu1, suggesting ligands of VKRs could be amino-acids or derivatives.</p><p>Accordingly, among the various molecules known to bind VFTM of class C GPCRs (glutamate, GABA, L-&#x003b1;- amino acids), we could show that L-arginine was able to increase <italic>in vitro</italic> the basal kinase activity of AmVKR, suggesting that this aminoacid could be a preferential ligand for VKR receptors, similarly to the mammalian GPRC6A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Wellendorph1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> and the fish OR5.24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Alioto1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> receptors, two class C GPCRs for which L-arginine is also a potent agonist. Moreover, it is important to mention that in insects, VFTM-containing mX receptors are modulated by arginine and derivatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Mitri1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Grau1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Future investigations will concern the biological role of VKR in development and reproduction, particularly in insects. The presence of high levels of <italic>vkr</italic> transcripts in larval forms and in female gonads of different organisms already supposed the importance of VKR proteins in larval growth and differentiation as well as in reproduction. RNA interference experiments are currently performed in honey bee and mosquitoes in order to elucidate the function of VKR in these processes. Since ovary development in mosquitoes has been shown to be regulated by TOR (Target of Rapamycin)- mediated amino acid signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Hansen1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005651-Hansen2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, we will also investigate the importance of VKR signalling in anautogeny, ie activation of egg development after a blood meal, a unique feature in the life of mosquitoes.</p><p>In conclusion, VKR constitute a novel family of RTK specific for invertebrates, mainly expressed in reproductive organs and activated by aminoacids. The biological function of these receptors is yet unknown but if VKR are effectively implied in reproduction of parasites (like schistosomes) or in disease-transmitting insects (like <italic>Anopheles</italic> vector of malaria or <italic>Aedes</italic> vector of filaria and viruses), these receptors already represent interesting drug targets for novel strategies to combat parasitic and infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005651.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Genbank accession numbers of receptors used in phylogenetic analyses.</p><p>(0.07 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005651.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Eric Haubruge (<italic>T. castaneum</italic> model), Catherine Bourgouin (<italic>A. gambiae</italic> model), Karen Wilson (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic> model), Genevi&#x000e8;ve Pr&#x000e9;vost (<italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> model) for biological material providing and helpful discussions.
