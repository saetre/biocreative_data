Here we report that neuropilin tolloid-like 1 (Neto1), a complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1 (CUB) domain-containing transmembrane protein, is a novel component of the NMDAR complex critical for maintaining the abundance of NR2A-containing NMDARs in the postsynaptic density. Neto1-null mice have depressed long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, with the subunit dependency of LTP induction switching from the normal predominance of NR2A- to NR2B-NMDARs. NMDAR-dependent spatial learning and memory is depressed in Neto1-null mice, indicating that Neto1 regulates NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and cognition. Remarkably, we also found that the deficits in LTP, learning, and memory in Neto1-null mice were rescued by the ampakine CX546 at doses without effect in wild-type. Together, our results establish the principle that auxiliary proteins are required for the normal abundance of NMDAR subunits at synapses, and demonstrate that an inherited learning defect can be rescued pharmacologically, a finding with therapeutic implications for humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The fundamental unit for information processing in the brain is the synapse, a highly specialized site of communication between the brain's multitude of individual neurons. The strength of the communication at each synapse changes in response to neuronal activity&#x02014;a process called synaptic plasticity&#x02014;allowing networks of neurons to adapt and learn. How synaptic plasticity occurs is a major question in neurobiology. A central player in synaptic plasticity is an assembly of synaptic proteins called the NMDA receptor complex. Here, we discovered that the protein Neto1 is a component of the NMDA receptor complex. Neto1-deficient mice had a dramatic decrease in the number of NMDA receptors at synapses and consequently, synaptic plasticity and learning were impaired. By indirectly enhancing the function of the residual NMDA receptors in Neto1-deficient mice with a small molecule, we restored synaptic plasticity and learning to normal levels. Our findings establish the principle that inherited abnormalities of synaptic plasticity and learning due to NMDA receptor dysfunction can be pharmacologically corrected. Our discoveries also suggest that synaptic proteins that share a molecular signature, called the CUB domain, with Neto1 may be important components of synaptic receptors across species, because several CUB-domain proteins in worms have also been found to regulate synaptic receptors.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Spatial learning and memory depend on the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, a synaptic ion channel regulated by Neto1.

Consequently, if the decrease in NMDAR EPSCs was due to the reduced level of NR2A-NMDARs, the relative contribution of NR2B-NMDARs to synaptic NMDAR currents would be predicted to be increased in Neto1-null mice. We therefore compared the effect of blocking NR2B-NMDARs using the NR2B-selective antagonist, Ro25&#x02013;6981 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, in wild-type and Neto1-null mice. Because Ro25&#x02013;6981 is a use-dependent NMDAR blocker, we continued the regular synaptic activation (0.1 Hz) during Ro25&#x02013;6981 application and calculated its effect only after NMDAR EPSCs had stabilized, 20&#x02013;30 min after the start of Ro25&#x02013;6981 administration. In wild-type synapses, Ro25&#x02013;6981 (2 &#x003bc;M) reduced NMDAR EPSCs by &#x0223c;30&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000041-g009">Figure 9</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000041-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

Moreover, in Neto1-null synapses, but not in those of wild-type mice, the component of the NMDAR EPSC resistant to Ro25&#x02013;6981 (2 &#x003bc;M) decayed more rapidly than did the component sensitive to Ro25&#x02013;6981 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000041-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, the absence of Neto1 decreases the relative contribution of NR2A-containing receptors to NMDAR EPSCs at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses.</p><p>We investigated the impact of the decrease of synaptic NR2A-mediated currents on tbLTP at Schaffer collateral synapses.

These findings indicate that tbLTP in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of adult Neto1-null mice is mediated primarily by NR2B-containing NMDARs.

We have shown that Neto1 interacts with NMDARs through the extracellular domain of their NR2 subunits, as well as intracellularly through PSD-95. Although Neto1 binds to both NR2A and NR2B, the loss of Neto1 leads to a reduction in the abundance of NR2A, but not NR2B, in the PSD fraction from hippocampus and a reduction in NR2A puncta in the CA1 region. Consistent with the reduction in NR2A protein in the PSDs of Neto1-null mice, which had no change in total NR2A abundance in whole brain, we identified a decrease in NMDAR EPSCs at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, which are normally dominated by NR2A-containing receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Blockade of NR2B-containing NMDARs in Neto1-null neurons caused a dramatic decrease in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, indicating that the majority of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in Neto1-null hippocampal neurons are contributed by NR2B-containing NMDARs and not NR2A-NMDARs. These findings indicate that Neto1 plays a critical role in maintaining the delivery or stability of NR2A-containing NMDARs at CA1 synapses.</p><p>The preferential effect of the loss of Neto1 on the abundance of synaptic, but not total, NR2A-containing NMDARs would not have been predicted from studies on the basis of the disruption of other NMDAR-interacting proteins. Rather than having a specific regulatory role on synaptic targeting of NMDARs like Neto1, loss of function of the other NMDAR-interacting proteins studied to date affects the overall cellular trafficking, function, or downstream signaling of NMDARs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. In its role in targeting NR2A-NMDARs to the synapse, Neto1 may be comparable to the TARPs, which control targeting of AMPARs to synapses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;. Our identification of Neto1 as a critical auxiliary protein for NR2A-NMDARs raises the possibility that other proteins, perhaps other CUB domain proteins, may be required, like Neto1, to maintain non-NR2A-NMDARs at synapses. Thus, Neto1 represents a new protein that functions to specifically maintain synaptic NMDARs, a protein that has been elusive for NMDARs.</p><p>The loss of synaptic NR2A-containing receptors in the Neto1-null mice implies that the molecular events regulating the delivery or stability of NR2A-NMDARs at the synapse differ from those regulating NR2B-NMDARs. Despite the ability of Neto1 to bind to both NR2A and NR2B subunits in vitro, the differential effect of Neto1 on NR2A- versus NR2B-containing NMDARs in vivo, might be mediated by the extracellular, membrane or cytoplasmic domains of these NR2 subunits. The membrane domains of NR2A and NR2B, however, are over 95&#x00025; identical and are therefore unlikely to be responsible for the differential effect of loss of Neto1. The extracellular domains of NR2A and NR2B are 54&#x00025; identical, being dominated by the S1 ligand-binding region and the amino terminal domain, with the extreme N-terminal sequence being the most divergent. The cytoplasmic domains of NR2A and NR2B are the most divergent, having only 29&#x00025; sequence identity. Differences in motifs within the extracellular or cytoplasmic domains may thus be responsible for the differential effect on synaptic NR2A NMDARs in the Neto1-null mice.</p><p>The functional consequences of the differences between NR2A and NR2B have been most clearly delineated for their cytoplasmic domains. For example, the endocytic motifs in the distal C termini of NR2A and NR2B, LL and YEKL, respectively, have been demonstrated to interact with clathrin adaptor complexes with different affinities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. After endocytosis, NR2A and NR2B sort into different intracellular pathways, with NR2B preferentially trafficking to recycling endosomes. Other studies indicate that the cytoplasmic domains of NR2A and NR2B preferentially associate with unique sets of proteins. For example, NR2B but not NR2A interacts with Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (Ras-GRF1), which is critical for NMDAR-mediated activation of ERK &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. NR2B also binds preferentially to CaMKII &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b048">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; allowing CaMKII to remain active after the dissociation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>/calmodulin. NR2 subunit-specific signalling mechanisms can therefore be dictated, in part, by the properties and context conferred by the different associated proteins. Thus, the Neto1-dependent subunit-specific regulation may reflect differences in NR2-NMDAR associated proteins.</p><p>The loss of Neto1, while having no effect on basal AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, suppresses LTP to a degree comparable to that observed in mice lacking NR2A &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; or its C-terminal tail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;.

Moreover, the spatial memory deficit of Neto1-null mice in the Morris water maze task is comparable to that of NR2A-null mice: the initial acquisition is normal, but other tests of spatial memory are impaired including, for example, the &#x0201c;spontaneous spatial novelty preference test&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;.

The deficits in the Neto1-null mice indicate that Neto1 may have specific roles in the acquisition of spatial memory.

Loss of function of these three CUB domain proteins has no impact on the overall abundance of the associated receptor complexes. Rather, loss of Neto1 and LEV-10 each leads to a reduction in synaptic localization of the cognate receptors, whereas loss of SOL-1 leads to a loss of function of normally distributed GLR-1. Both Neto1 and SOL-1 interact with ionotropic subunits by an extracellular CUB domain. Binding of a soluble CUB domain of SOL-1 partially rescues the function of GLR-1 ionotropic receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. It is not yet known whether soluble Neto1 CUB domains can rescue the impaired LTP or the reduced number of NR2A-containing receptors at hippocampal excitatory synapses in Neto1-null mice. Because Neto1, SOL-1, and LEV-10 are associated with neurotransmitter receptors of different classes, our work suggests that a critical interaction with a CUB domain-containing protein may be a general characteristic of ligand-gated ion channels throughout nature.</p><p>In Neto1-null mice, the impairments in LTP and spatial learning were rescued by the ampakine CX546, administered acutely by bathing hippocampal slices in the drug prior to LTP-inducing stimulation, or by administering it systemically prior to each training session, respectively. Importantly, CX546 was used at doses that we demonstrated to have no effect on synaptic plasticity or learning in wild-type mice. This is the first report of a pharmacological rescue of an NMDAR impairment, and consequently, our results extend the principle that in vertebrates, an inherited defect in synaptic plasticity and spatial learning can be corrected in the adult &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. We showed that CX546 prolongs AMPAR-mediated EPSCs and that the prolongation is the same in wild-type and Neto1-null mice, but that it does not affect NMDAR-mediated EPSCs or paired pulse facilitation. Consequently, the most parsimonious explanation of the CX546-mediated rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000041-g014">Figure 14</xref>) is that it indirectly facilitates NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses by prolonging AMPAR EPSCs, extending the temporary relief of the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> blockade and thereby increasing Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx through NMDARs to the wild-type level required for full expression of the LTP signaling cascade &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. A comparable strategy of modulating non-NMDARs to secondarily facilitate NMDAR currents has also been used, but with a genetic approach, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>: the disruption of foraging behaviour by mutant NMDARs was restored by a slowly desensitizing variant of the non-NMDARs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, we expect that a slowly desensitizing AMPAR variant would rescue LTP in the Neto1-null mice. The recovery of LTP or learning by CX546 could be explained by facilitation of either NR2A- or NR2B-NMDAR mediated responses. However, we found that the fully rescued LTP is suppressed by more than 65&#x00025; in Neto1-null hippocampal slices by Ro25&#x02013;6981, at a dose that is without effect on LTP in wild- type slices indicating that NR2B-NMDARs, and not only NR2A-NMDARs, are required for the rescue of LTP. Hence, the rescue of spatial learning observed in Neto1-null mice may also be dependent on NR2B-NMDARs.</p><fig id="pbio-1000041-g014" position="float"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><title>Proposed Model by Which CX546 Rescues Impaired LTP at Neto1-Null Schaffer Collateral-CA1 Synapses</title><p>(A) Left: At wild-type synapses, during basal synaptic transmission, glutamate release activates AMPA receptors, causing a depolarization of the synaptic membrane.

Mice lacking Neto1 have a normal abundance of NR2B-containing NMDAR receptors but a reduction of NR2A-containing receptors at hippocampal excitatory synapses. The reduction of NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents, impaired synaptic plasticity at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, and impaired spatial learning observed in the Neto1-null animals can be attributed to the decreased levels of NR2A-containing receptors at hippocampal excitatory synapses. Altogether, our findings establish that Neto1 is an important regulator of the NMDAR complex required for normal NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity and learning. Our results, together with the identification of the CUB domain proteins SOL-1 and LEV-10 as regulators of ionotropic receptors in nematode, suggest that a critical interaction with a CUB domain protein may be a common feature of different types of ligand-gated ion channels across species. Moreover, our studies establish the principle that inherited abnormalities of synaptic plasticity and spatial cognition due to NMDAR dysfunction can be pharmacologically corrected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Neto1 cloning and gene targeting.</title><p>Human UniGene clusters were analyzed using the BLAST algorithm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000041-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d; to identify proteins with motifs suggestive of a neurodevelopmental function.

Thigmotaxis: swimming along the edge of the wall or wall-hugging. Random search: randomly swimming over the entire area of the pool. Scanning: adopting a more systematic and efficient way of swimming in the central area of the pool. Chaining: memorizing a specific distance between the platform and the wall and swimming in wide circles to all possible platform locations at that distance. Focal search: restricted swimming to a specific area of the pool. Focal search signifies the beginning of spatial navigation and it could be separated into focal search in the correct target quadrant and focal search in the incorrect quadrants. The highest level of precision in spatial navigation is reached when the animal employs direct swims to the platform, independent of its release point. Swim strategies were characterized according to the predominant swim strategy used during the entire length of each trial and overall swim strategies were presented as the percentage of time spent on the strategy of choice.

The open field apparatus consisted of a cubical box (41 &#x000d7; 41 &#x000d7; 33 cm) made of clear Perspex (Ugo Basile) that was connected to horizontal and vertical infrared sensors. All behavioural events were video recorded and analyzed using Observer 5.0 software (Noldus Information Technology). The test consisted of four sessions with intertrial intervals of 2 min during which mice were returned to their home cage. During the open field session, each mouse was placed into the center of the empty, brightly lit open field for 5 min and the baseline level of locomotion (horizontal and vertical activity) and other behavioural parameters were recorded. The behavioural parameters were latency to escape the center; time of freezing (remaining in one place with only slight movement of the head); time of self-grooming; number of risk assessments (behaviour involving the mouse stretching its body from the corners/wall towards the center). Exploratory activity and walking were recorded separately for the central and peripheral field of the open arena, and the ratio between duration of central and peripheral activity was calculated.</p><p>During the habituation session, four different plastic objects were presented in the open field: cube (5 &#x000d7; 5 &#x000d7; 5 cm); hollow cylinder (6 cm height and 4 cm diameter); solid cylinder (3 cm height &#x000d7; 6 cm diameter); and prism (3.5 &#x000d7; 4.5 &#x000d7; 6 cm). Exploration of the four different plastic objects in the open field were measured every 5 min for 15 min under dim lighting (habituation profile). In the spatial object recognition session, the four objects, initially placed in a square arrangement, were reconfigured into a polygon-shaped pattern by moving two DOs. The remaining two objects were left at the same location (nondisplaced objects &#x0005b;NDOs&#x0005d;). Times of exploration of the DO and NDO were recorded for 5 min and expressed as a percentage of the total time of objects investigated. In the novel object recognition session, one of the familiar NDOs was replaced with a new object (NO) at the same location and the two familiar DOs were removed. The time examining a NO or a familiar object (FO) was recorded for 5 min and was expressed as a percentage of the total time of objects investigated. Data were analyzed with ANOVA with genotype as a between-subjects factor, and object rearrangement or object replacement as a repeated measures factor. The Tukey test was used for post hoc comparisons when ANOVA yielded statistically significant main effects or interactions.</p><p>To examine the effects of CX546 in spatial learning, new cohorts of Neto1-null and wild-type littermate mice were used for the water maze and displaced-object tasks.
