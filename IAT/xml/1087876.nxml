Although the reasons for the aggressive growth behavior of pancreatic cancer are not completely understood, recent molecular biological studies have revealed several factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. These include genetic changes, such as k-ras, p53, p16, and Smad4 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], as well as epigenetic alterations, such as overexpression of a number of growth factors and their receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Membrane-associated heparin-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are thought to play an important role in many aspects of cellular physiology including growth factor signaling. HSPGs are required for the optimal activity of heparin-binding growth factors, such as for example fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. One member of the HSPG family, glypican-1 is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer and influences heparin binding growth factor signaling in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The heparan-sulfate (HS) chains of HSPGs seem to interact with the ligands (e.g. FGF-2) and high-affinity FGF-receptors, to increase ligand-receptor binding and signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The enzyme Hsulf-1 is a recently identified human sulfatase, which exhibits arylsulfatase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Hsulf-1 expression is down-regulated in ovarian cancers, and lost in a proportion of liver cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Absence or low levels of Hsulf-1 in hepatocellular, ovarian, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were associated with up-regulation of heparin-binding growth factor signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since HSPGs such as glypican-1 play an important role in pancreatic cancer and since Hsulf-1 can influence the sulfation state and the biological function of HSPGs, the expression and functional role of Hsulf-1 was analyzed in pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Hsulf-1 mRNA expression in pancreatic tissues</title><p>Utilizing DNA arrays the expression of nine sulfatase family members in pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cancer metastasis, chronic pancreatitis and the normal pancreas was screened. This analysis revealed that Hsulf-1 was significantly over-expressed in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis compared to normal pancreatic tissues. Thus, Hsulf-1 mRNA expression levels were increased 9.1-fold in primary pancreatic cancer, 4.5-fold in pancreatic cancer metastasis, and 3.4-fold in CP tissues compared to normal pancreatic tissues. In contrast, there were only minor or no changes in the mRNA levels of the other members of the sulfatase family (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In order to better quantify Hsulf-1 expression quantitative RT-PCR was carried out in normal pancreatic tissue samples (n = 19), chronic pancreatitis (n = 22) and pancreatic cancer tissue samples (n = 31). The samples from normal tissues had a mean (+/- SEM) number of Hsulf-1 transcripts/&#x003bc;l of 114 &#x000b1; 23, while Hsulf-1 mRNA levels increased in both chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, with mean (+/- SEM) transcripts levels of 2054 &#x000b1; 911 in chronic pancreatitis and 2566 &#x000b1; 420 in pancreatic cancer. 10 of 22 (45%) CP and 22 of 31 (71%) pancreatic cancer tissue samples displayed higher copy numbers of Hsulf-1 mRNA than the highest Hsulf-1 mRNA level observed in normal pancreatic tissue samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Expression of different sulfatases in normal pancreas (No), chronic pancreatitis (CP), primary pancreatic cancer (CA) and pancreatic cancer metastasis (Mx) tissues as determined by DNA array analysis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left" colspan="3"><bold>Fold change</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold>Ca vs No</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Mx vs No</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>CP vs No</bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>hSulf-1</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>9.1</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>4.5</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>3.4</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Arylsulfatase A</bold></td><td align="left">0.6</td><td align="left">0.8</td><td align="left">0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Arylsulfatase B</bold></td><td align="left">1.8</td><td align="left">1.6</td><td align="left">1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Arylsulfatase C</bold></td><td align="left">1.6</td><td align="left">1.8</td><td align="left">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Arylsulfatase D</bold></td><td align="left">0.5</td><td align="left">0.2</td><td align="left">0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Arylsulfatase E</bold></td><td align="left">0.5</td><td align="left">0.6</td><td align="left">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>galactosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfate sulfatase</bold></td><td align="left">0.8</td><td align="left">0.8</td><td align="left">0.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>glucosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase</bold></td><td align="left">2.5</td><td align="left">2.2</td><td align="left">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>iduronate 2-sulfatase</bold></td><td align="left">1.0</td><td align="left">1.2</td><td align="left">1.0</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Hsulf-1 mRNA in pancreatic tissues and cell lines </bold>Quantification of Hsuf-1 mRNA levels in the normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic cancer tissues (PC), by real time QRT-PCR as described in the <italic>Material and Methods </italic>section.

This analysis revealed relatively high expression of Hsulf-1 mRNA in Su-8686 and moderate expression in T3M4, Colo-357, and BxPc-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines. In the other cell lines, Hsulf-1 expression was below the detection level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3 A</xref>). Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells were selected for Hsulf-1 transfection, since Hsulf-1 expression was below the level of detection in this cell line. To confirm successful transfection of Panc-1 cells with the full-length Hsulf-1 construct, Northern blot analysis was carried out using a Hsulf-1 antisense riboprobe. A total of number 36 clones were screened, of which 10 clones clearly expressed Hsulf-1 mRNA. Two Hsulf-1 positive clones (sulf-26 and sulf-38) were selected for use in further experiments and compared to empty vector-transfected (EV) and non transfected wild type (WT) Panc-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3 B</xref>). To confirm the expression of Hsulf-1 in the positive clones on the protein level, immunoblotting was performed. Since the Hsulf-1 expression plasmid contained a c-myc tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], it was possible to detect the expression of the Hsulf-1-myc fusion protein in the selected clones by immunoblot analysis with an anti-c-myc antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3 C</xref>). To determine the activity of the expressed sulfatase, cellular extracts prepared from both control (wild type and empty vector) and transfected clones (sulf-26, sulf-38) were analyzed. 4-Methylumbelliferyl-sulfate, which represents a substrate for a variety of sulfatases, including cellular steroid sulfatases, was used as the substrate for sulfatase activity. Upon transfection, sulfatase activity was most prominently increased in clone sulf-38 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3 D</xref>). However, since this assay could not differentiate between different sulfatases, high sulfatase activity was also observed in the control cells. Therefore, to further confirm successful transfection and increased Hsulf-1 activity, immunofluorescence with the 10E4 anti-HSPG monoclonal antibody, which recognizes N-sulfated glucosamine-containing HSPGs, was carried out. Prominent staining of the cell membrane was observed in both wild type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and empty vector Panc-1 cells (Figure 4 C). In contrast, markedly diminished staining of the cell membrane was observed in the two Hsulf-1 expressing clones (Figure 4 B, D), indicating that Hsulf-1 desulfates HSPGs at the cell surface.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of Hsulf-1 in pancreatic cancer cell lines </bold><bold>(A) </bold>Quantification of Hsulf-1 mRNA levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines by real time QRT-PCR as described in the <italic>Materials and Methods </italic>section.

Therefore, we further investigated whether over-expression of Hsulf-1 could modulate the function of these growth factors in pancreatic cancer cells. Two Hsulf-1 transfected clones and two controls (wild type and empty vector) were selected to perform growth assays in the presence or absence of different doses of the indicated growth factors. Hsulf-1 expression significantly attenuated FGF-2 (50 ng/ml) induced cell growth by around 50%, from +28.0 &#x000b1; 3.8% in controls to +14.4 &#x000b1; 1.0 % in Hsulf-1 clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast, there was no difference in the response towards IGF-1, EGF or HB-EGF in the control versus Hsulf-1 expressing cells. Since Hsulf-1 expression reduced FGF-2 but not EGF or HB-EGF induced cell proliferation, next we sought to investigate whether Hsulf-1 expression would influence FGF-2 and EGF/HB-EGF downstream signaling. EGFR phosphorylation was not changed in response to EGF or HB-EGF in Hsulf-1 expressing clones compared to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7 A</xref>). In addition, there was also no difference of EGF and HB-EGF induced MAPK phosphorylation between control cells and positive clones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7 A</xref>). In contrast, control cells showed increased MAPK phosphorylation after FGF-2 stimulation, while this FGF-2 induced phosphorylation was markedly attenuated in Hsulf-1 transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7 B</xref>). Next, the basal and FGF-2 induced invasion capacity of tumor cells was analyzed. This analysis revealed a significant reduction in the invasiveness of FGF-2 exposed Hsulf-1 expressing cells compared to Hsulf-1 negative clones. As demonstrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, FGF-2 (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) significantly stimulated the invasion of the control cells by +83.4 &#x000b1; 24.2% after 24 h of incubation.

The GI50 concentration of gemcitabine in the Panc-1 WT control cells was 3.9 nM, and in EV Panc-1 cells approximately 50 nM.

They are classified into arylsulfatases and nonarysulfatases according to their ability to hydrolyse the sulfate ester bonds of aromatic compounds such as p-nitrocatechol sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hsulf-1 is a newly identified member of the sulfatase family, which exhibits arysulfatase activity and removes sulfate from the C-6 position of glucosamine within the specific sub regions of intact heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In the present study a significant up-regulation of Hsulf-1 in primary pancreatic cancer, pancreatic metastasis and CP compared to normal pancreatic tissues was demonstrated, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression of other members of the sulfatase family in these tissues. This indicates that Hsulf-1 might play a specific role in the pathogenesis and evolution of CP and pancreatic cancer. Normal pancreatic tissues are composed mainly of a homogenous population of acinar cells (and a low percentage of ductal and islet cells), whereas both CP and pancreatic cancer tissues contain a variable amount of desmoplastic areas, inflammatory cells, degenerating acini, tubular complexes (and cancer cells). Thus, the observed wide range of expression of Hsulf-1 mRNA in both CP and pancreatic cancer tissues is most likely due to the different individual composition of these tissues. To confirm this hypothesis, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization was utilized to localize Hsulf-1 mRNA expression in normal, CP and pancreatic cancer tissues. This analysis demonstrated that Hsulf-1 mRNA expression was weakly present in normal acinar cells, and at high levels in the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, as well as in fibroblasts and tubular complexes in CP tissues and additionally in the malignant cells in pancreatic cancer tissues.</p><p>The observed increased levels of Hsulf-1 in pancreatic cancer tissues seem to be in contrast to the down-regulation of Hsulf-1 in HCC and ovarian tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, while in ovarian cancer markedly diminished levels were observed in approximately 75% of the cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], the percentage was much smaller in HCCs (30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting that reduced Hsulf-1 expression is not universally observed in all tumor types. It has been hypothesized that enhanced expression of Hsulf-1 is related to c-myc amplification in HCCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It could be speculated that also in pancreatic cancer high Hsulf-1 levels are related to c-myc amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], at least in a subset of tumors. Another interesting aspect is the generally low Hsulf-1 expression level in cultured cancer cell lines. Thus, Hsulf-1 expression is absent in 71% of ovarian cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], in 82% of HCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and in 50% of pancreatic cancer cell lines (present study).</p><p>To evaluate the functional importance of Hsulf-1 in pancreatic cancer cells, Panc-1 cells, which do not express Hsulf-1 at detectable levels, were stably transfected with a Hsulf-1 expression vector. Over-expression of Hsulf-1 in Panc-1 cells resulted in reduced anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth, suggesting an important growth regulatory role of this gene in pancreatic cancer. These tumors are characterized by enhanced expression of a variety of growth factors and their receptors, which have the capacity to influence different cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some of these growth factors are heparin-binding growth factors, such as FGFs, VEGF and HB-EGF. We hypothesized that Hsulf-1 expression would attenuate the effects of these growth factors by desulfation of HSPGs resulting in a growth disadvantage as suggested for other tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. FGF-2 stimulated cell proliferation was attenuated by the expression of Hsulf-1. Nonetheless, FGF-2 still induced growth in Hsulf-1 expressing cells, but to a lesser extent compared with control cells. It is conceivable that the HSPG/FGF receptor complex can facilitate FGF-2 signaling, but may not be strictly required for binding of FGF-2 to its receptor; it only increases the affinity of the FGF-2/FGF receptor interaction to a certain degree. Hsulf-1 expression in Panc-1 cells also partially blocked FGF-2 induced MAPK phosphorylation and invasion, further supporting the hypothesis that Hsulf-1 interferes with FGF-2 signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. In contrast, no difference between Hsulf-1 expressing and control cells was observed upon stimulation with HB-EGF &#x02013; another heparin-binding growth factor- as well as EGF and IGF-1 suggesting that these growth factors and their receptors do not require sulfated HSPGs for effective signaling. The observation that Hsulf-1 expression does not interfere with HB-EGF signaling in pancreatic cancer cells is in contrast to recent studies in ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], suggesting cell type specific differences.</p><p>Previously, it has been shown that Hsulf-1 expression enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the present study, we did not observe increased sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents in Hsulf-1 expressing versus control cells. In contrast, Hsulf-1 expressing Panc-1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine than the control cells, thereby suggesting that Hsulf-1 over-expression might confer increased chemoresistance to pancreatic cancer cells and thus provide them with a growth advantage. However, the reason behind this effect is currently not known and requires further analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, Hsulf-1 is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis compared to normal pancreatic tissues, mainly due to over-expression in the desmoplastic and cancerous tissue elements. Expression of Hsulf-1 in Panc-1 cells negatively influences growth and invasion by attenuating FGF-2 signaling, suggesting that Hsulf-1 plays a specific role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Further experimental approaches, especially <italic>in vivo </italic>studies, will help to assess in more detail the role of this enzyme in human pancreatic cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>DMEM, trypsin-EDTA, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen (Mannheim, Germany); FBS from PAN Biotech (Aidenbach, Germany); Gene screen hybridization transfer membranes from PerkinElmer Life Science (Boston, MA, USA); <sup>32</sup>P CTP from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany); Lipofectamine reagent&#x02122; and TRIzol Reagent from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany); RiboMAX&#x02122; Large Scale RNA production system, antibiotic G-418 sulfate from Promega (Mannheim, Gemany); Gemcitabine-Hydrochloride from Lilly (Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Hampshire, UK); Recombinant human FGF-2, Recombinant human IGF-1, Recombinant human HB-EGF from R&#x00026;D systems (Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany); p-EGFR (Tyr 1173) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p-P44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Frankfurt, Germany); EGF from Upstate Biotechnology (Hamburg, Germany); monoclonal anti-Heparan sulfate (10-E4 epitope) from Seikagaju Corporation (Tokyo, Japan); Labeled goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands); Anti-c-Myc antibody from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany); Anti-goat IgG HRP- linked antibodies, anti-mouse IgG HRP- linked antibodies, anti-rabbit IgG HRP- linked antibodies and ECL immunoblotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences (Freiburg, Germany); complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets from Roche (Mannheim, Germany); DIFCO Noble agar from DIFCO Laboratories (Detroit, MI,) All other reagents were from Sigma (Munich, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA array</title><p>The GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>HG-U95Av2 array used in this study was fabricated by Affymetrix Inc.
