Cells expressing the estrogen receptor ERalpha are present in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) but changes in expression due to estrogen and inflammation have not been characterized. In this study, ERalpha protein content and the number of cells expressing ERalpha was measured in 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats after inflammation was induced in the TMJ.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixteen ovariectomized female rats were divided into two groups such that one group received 17 beta estradiol (E2) and the other was given vehicle (VEH). Groups were then subdivided further, one received injections of saline and the other received Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) within the superior joint space of the TMJ. Thus the four groups include no E2/saline, E2/saline, no E2/CFA and E2/CFA. After treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the TMJ anterior, disc, retrodiscal and synovial tissues were analyzed by western blot and immunocytochemistry. Positive stained cells were counted using a Nikon epifluorescent microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The western blot showed that ERalpha protein significantly decreased with inflammation. The number of ERalpha-positive cells in the TMJ was not affected by inflammation or 17 beta-estradiol with exception of the retrodiscal tissue. In the retrodiscal tissue 17 beta-estradiol significantly decreased the number of ERalpha-positive cells but only in a non-inflamed joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, inflammation and 17 beta-estradiol can modulate ERalpha expression in the TMJ but the effects are tissue specific.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that during their reproductive years, women experience a higher frequency of temporomandibular joint disorders than males with a ratio of = 1.5- 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It has been postulated that estrogen could be the primary molecule leading to the higher frequency of TMJ disorders in women. Endogenous estrogen affects the remodeling processes within the TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] possibly by changing the extracellular matrix in the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or by changing bone volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Such changes can result in internal derangement of the TMJ. Estrogen modulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression has also been observed in the cartilage of the TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]; high levels of MMP have been reported to play a role in TMJ osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the level of estrogen in the synovial fluid has been correlated to the severity of arthritis in postmenopausal women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and in animal models estrogen has been shown to modulate inflammation in the TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>17 &#x003b2;-estradiol is the most potent and dominant form of estrogen in the human female, having biological effects through binding the estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;) and beta (ER&#x003b2;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; acts via binding to the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or by having biological effects through interacting with various kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase or tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Also both receptors can interact with membrane-associated molecules such as ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors to alter the physiology of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The wide distribution of the estrogen receptors ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; in the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and spleen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] suggests that it plays a modulatory role in the immune system, such as modulating differentiation, activation, proliferation and antibody production from lymphoid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Immune responses are important in joint disorders and an alteration in ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; expression would have an impact on how estrogen affects the immune response in the TMJ.</p><p>In particular, ER&#x003b1; was found in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone of TMJ which implies that estrogen directly acted on the cells in the TMJ tissue to alter the gene expression and cellular physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast to the ER&#x003b1; expression in the rat, ER&#x003b1; nuclear staining was not detected in the bone, cartilaginous or connective tissues of the human or baboon TMJ, but it was present in the immune cells such as macrophage and lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In addition ER knockout studies have shown a major role for ER&#x003b1; in immune modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because ER&#x003b1; is present in the immune cells in the human TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a likely target of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol in the human TMJ is ER&#x003b1;-positive immune cells. Furthermore ER-&#x003b1; gene polymorphisms is associated with a predisposition to TMJ disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Such data from both animal and clinical studies support a significant role of ER&#x003b1; in the increased incidence of TMJ inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In an intact rat 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol and progesterone concentrations change during the estrus cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Multiple fluctuating hormones could complicate our understanding of how 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol modulates estrogen receptor expression. Hormone administration in overiectomized animals allows us to study the effect of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol, avoiding fluctuating levels. Thus, our study was focused on the effect of a single, physiological concentration of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol. This concentration of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol was equal to that observed during the estrus cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The level of receptor will determine the cellular sensitivity to 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol, because this hormone acts primarily through the estrogen receptor(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This paper particularly focuses on ER&#x003b1; expression in response to17&#x003b2;-estradiol and inflammation. The aim of the present study is to first quantify the tissue content of ER&#x003b1; in the female rat TMJ, and second, to determine whether changes in the ER&#x003b1; expression in the TMJ result from alterations in inflammation or the concentration of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue preparation</title><p>The Baylor College of Dentistry Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol. Female Sprague Dawley rats (~230 gm) were ovariectomized by Harlan Industries, Houston TX. Upon arrival, the rats were housed individually and kept on a 14:10 h light/dark cycle with lights on at 0600 h. All the rats were anesthetized with ketamine (45 mg/kg) and rompun (4.8 mg/kg). Using sterile technique, the rats were implanted with primed, 14-day Alzet mini-osmotic pumps dispensing vehicle, polyethylene glycol (no estrogen replacement control group) or 750 ng/day of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol benzoate. These animals were then subdivided further; one group received bilateral injections of 0.9% saline (30 &#x003bc;l) and the other group received an injection of 30 &#x003bc;g (30 &#x003bc;l) of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) within the superior joint space of the TMJ just above the disc. The animals were removed from their cages and sacrificed with an overdose of CO<sub>2 </sub>after 48 h. The animals were decapitated; blood collected and the heads were placed in plastic bags and submerged in ice water. For western analysis, the TMJ anterior, disc, retrodiscal and synovium were dissected from one side by performing a superficial, horizontal skin incision parallel and just inferior to the zygomatic arch. The masseter and temporalis muscles were cut away from the arch and the ramus of the mandible so that the arch could be removed with ronjeurs. The neck of the condyle was grasped with hemostats and the condylar neck fractured to allow removal of any remaining musculature and access to the anterior, disc, retrodiscal and synovial tissues. Dissected TMJ tissue was excised from the posterior neck of the condyle, and all anterior tissue, articular disc, retrodiscal tissue and synovium were removed, placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. For histological analysis, a 0.5 cm cube of TMJ tissue centered on the condyle was removed, en bloc, from the other side and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4&#x000b0;C overnight. The tissue was then decalcified in 10% EDTA for 2 weeks, embedded in paraffin wax and 8 &#x003bc;m sections were cut and mounted on Superfrost glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for immunohistochemical or hematoxylin and eosin staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitation of hormone levels</title><p>17 &#x003b2;-estradiol was quantitated in the blood plasma by first, vigorously mixing 0.5 ml of plasma with 5 ml of ether.

Each sample was tested for protein content by standard BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL); 10 &#x003bc;g of total protein was loaded onto a SDS PAGE, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 1.5% v/v BSA in TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking, the ER&#x003b1; mouse monoclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added at a dilution of 1:1000 overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The membrane was then incubated for 2 h with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The products were detected by means of an enhanced chemiluminescence light detection kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

Induction of inflammation decreased the expression of ER&#x003b1; in the TMJ of rats injected with and without 17&#x003b2;-estradiol. 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol reduced the number of ER&#x003b1; positive cells in the retrodiscal tissue but only in animals that did not have an inflammation, suggesting first that 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol acts in a tissue specific manner in the TMJ region and second that the inflammation can alter the effect of estradiol.</p><p>Knowing that on western blots estrogen receptor levels decreased in the TMJ region after injection of CFA, the question arose as to whether this decrease was due to a reduction in the number of cells expressing the receptor or to a decrease in the number of receptors per cell. For this reason we counted the number of cells expressing ER&#x003b1;. In the anterior and synovial tissue the number of ER&#x003b1; positive cells in the No E<sub>2</sub>/saline group trended (showed a trend to be) higher than in the No E<sub>2</sub>/CFA group, suggesting the CFA induced a decrease in ER&#x003b1; levels, consistent with the western results. Animals receiving 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol had a decreased amount of ER&#x003b1; on a western blot after CFA injection, but the number of ER&#x003b1; positive cells increased in the anterior and retrodiscal tissue. Whereas in the synovium the number of ER&#x003b1; positive cells did display a downward trend after CFA injection. Double stained ER&#x003b1; and CD14 positive immune cells observed in the retrodiscal area and synovium of all four groups suggest the presence of ER&#x003b1; positive immune cells consistent with the ER&#x003b1;-positive immune cells found in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Another study also shows that the synovium is highly populated with monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes stain for both ER&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although few in number, the ER&#x003b1; positive cells in the synovium might have much higher amounts of ER&#x003b1; per cell than the retrodiscal tissue. In the event that a majority of the ER&#x003b1; protein from the TMJ was derived from the synovium we would see a decrease in ER&#x003b1; after CFA injection, consistent with our western blot results. Our results showing that different tissues had a different response to 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol was consistent with studies done on rat uterus, demonstrating the upregulation of ER&#x003b1; in the stromal cells and its concurrent downregulation in the epithelia of the uterus in response to estradiol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Expression of the immune complex protein C3 was shown to be upregulated in the uterine epithelial cells in response to estradiol whereas expression in the liver was unaffected by the same concentration of estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In joint tissue 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol alters proteoglycan metabolism differently depending on location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>In the retrodiscal tissue the number of ER&#x003b1; positive cells increased or remained unchanged after CFA injection but the amount of ER&#x003b1; in each cell may have decreased leading to a reduction in the ER&#x003b1; observed on the western blot. To determine whether an increase in the expression per cell results in a higher expression of estrogen receptor, we needed to quantitate the fluorescent signal in each cell. Unfortunately, the florescent signal faded rapidly and we could not determine the intensity of staining per cell (i.e. ER&#x003b1; expression per cell) and thus, we could not determine what led to the decrease in estrogen receptor signal on the western blot.</p><p>The number of cells expressing ER&#x003b1; in the retrodiscal tissue was significantly lower in the 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol-treated rat. In humans, the estrogen receptors are present on peri-vascular immune cells (e.g., macrophages) in the TMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol treatment has been shown to modulate gene expression in the macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In vivo studies have shown that macrophage proliferation increases with an increased estrogen concentration in female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], implying that estrogen can increase ER&#x003b1; levels though stimulation of macrophage proliferation. Since we did not see an increase in ER&#x003b1; positive cell numbers, macrophage proliferation was not a likely cause for the increased ER&#x003b1; expression. Another possible explanation for the reduction in ER&#x003b1; expression may be that 17&#x003b2;-estradiol caused a down-regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] similar to previous studies that indicated 17&#x003b2;-estradiol inhibits ER&#x003b1; expression in joint tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, this previous study also showed that inflammation effectively blocked the inhibitory effect of 17&#x003b2;-estradiol, consistent with our results in the retrodiscal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Studies have also demonstrated decreased specific binding of radiolabeled 17&#x003b2;-estradiol with E2 treatment which resulted in a depletion of cytosolic ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Down-regulation of estrogen receptor was suggested to involve some transcriptional activation mechanisms such as proteasome-mediated proteolysis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A constant physiological concentration of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol effects ER&#x003b1; expression in a non-inflamed and inflamed TMJ. But several questions remain such as what are the effects of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol on ER&#x003b2; in the TMJ tissues and what are the effects of progesterone or pregnancy levels of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol. Future studies would need to focus on the amount of receptor per cell in different tissues as well as determine the effect of higher concentrations of 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol such as that occuring during pregnancy (120 pg/ml). These studies might help develop estrogenic medications for TMJ pain. Moreover, progesterone could impact estrogen receptor expression and interact with 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol to alter its effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JP, BH and PRK participated in the design of the study, data collection, statistical analysis, and manuscript drafting.
