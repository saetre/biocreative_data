The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, the extreme sequence conservation, its nucleolar localization, the broad tissue distribution, and the many target genes with essential biological functions suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The molecular identification of genes and mutations affecting complex traits and disorders has proven to be very challenging in humans as well as in model organisms. These so-called quantitative traits arise from interactions between two or more genes and their environment, and can be mapped to their underlying genes via closely linked stretches of DNA called quantitative trait loci (QTL). Previously, we identified a single nucleotide substitution in a noncoding region of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (<italic>IGF2</italic>) in pigs that is underlying a major QTL affecting muscle growth, heart size, and fat deposition. The mutation disrupts interaction with an unknown nuclear protein acting as a repressor of <italic>IGF2</italic> transcription. In the present study, we have isolated a zinc finger protein of unknown function and show that it regulates the expression of <italic>IGF2</italic>. The protein, which we named ZBED6, is encoded by a domesticated DNA transposon that was inserted into the genome prior to the radiation of placental mammals. ZBED6 is exclusive to placental mammals and highly conserved among species. Our functional characterization of ZBED6 shows that it has a broad tissue distribution and may affect the expression of thousands of other genes, besides <italic>IGF2</italic>, that control fundamental biological processes. We postulate that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth in placental mammals.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Strong selection for lean growth in the domestic pigs during the last 60 years has resulted in increased muscle growth and reduced fat deposition. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using an intercross between the European Wild Boar and Large White domestic pigs identified the most important locus that has responded to this selection pressure as a paternally expressed QTL colocalized with the gene for insulin-like growth factor 2 (<italic>IGF2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Jeon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Elevated paternal expression from the mutant allele increases skeletal muscle mass and thus meat production by 3&#x00025;&#x02013;4&#x00025;. The favorable allele has undergone a massive selective sweep and is close to fixation in pig populations widely used for meat production. Pigs carrying the favorable allele at the paternal chromosome show higher expression from the <italic>IGF2</italic> P2, P3, and P4 promoters in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but not in liver. Importantly, this up-regulated <italic>IGF2</italic> expression occurs postnatally, but not in fetal muscle.

Two different nuclear extracts were prepared using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC) technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Ong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, in which the &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; extract proteins contained the stable-isotope&#x02013;labeled amino acids lysine and arginine, whereas the &#x0201c;light&#x0201d; extract proteins contained the natural versions of these amino acids. The wild-type and mutant oligonucleotides were incubated with heavy and light extracts, respectively. Captured heavy and light proteins were mixed and separated with SDS-PAGE.

The gene contains an open reading frame of more than 900 codons and encodes a protein with no sequence similarity to ZC3H11A. The encoded protein contains two BED domains and an hATC dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000256-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

The results presented in this study have conclusively demonstrated that ZBED6 is the bona fide repressor binding the QTN site in pig <italic>IGF2</italic>. This conclusion is based on (<italic>i</italic>) EMSA with recombinant ZBED6 protein, (<italic>ii</italic>) supershift of EMSA complex using an anti-ZBED6 antibody, (<italic>iii</italic>) abolishment of the repressor function in a luciferase assay after siRNA silencing, and (<italic>iv</italic>) ChIP data. The biological significance of ZBED6 was underscored in this study as siRNA silencing in C2C12 cells led to faster myotube formation and wound healing, and increased cell proliferation.</p><p>The difference between less complex eukaryotes like <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and more complex eukaryotes, such as human, is related not to the number of protein-coding genes, but rather to the complexity of the gene regulatory networks. A large proportion of vertebrate genomes is composed of transposable elements, and their integration in the genome has contributed to the evolution of regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Feschotte1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of these transposable elements are retrotransposons, but 5&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; are derived from DNA transposons. In the initial analysis of the first human genome assembly, Lander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Lander1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> identified 47 human genes derived from transposable elements, as many as 43 of these are derived from DNA transposons, and in fact, one of the genes listed in Table 13 of the human genome paper corresponds to <italic>ZBED6</italic>. However, <italic>ZBED6</italic> has never been appropriately annotated in any mammalian genome, despite the fact that it constitutes an &#x0223c;2,900-bp open reading frame and that part of the ZBED6 protein is extremely well conserved among placental mammals. A bioinformatic analysis of other vertebrate genomes did not reveal the presence of a functional <italic>ZBED6</italic> gene outside the placental mammals. We found evidence for a nonfunctional <italic>ZBED6</italic> sequence at the orthologous positions in the Platypus and opossum genomes, but these genomes did not contain an extended open reading frame for <italic>ZBED6</italic> (unpublished data). This implies that the integration of <italic>ZBED6</italic> happened before the divergence of the monotremes from the other mammals, but that the gene has been inactivated or lost in monotremes and marsupials. Thus, <italic>ZBED6</italic> must have evolved its essential function in the time span after the split between marsupial and placental mammals, but before the radiation of different orders of placental mammals. An interesting topic for future research will be to reveal what advantage the development of ZBED6 as a new regulatory protein has provided to the placental mammals.</p><p><italic>ZBED6</italic> is an apparent example of a domesticated transposon that has lost its ability to transpose, because it occurs as a single copy gene at the same location in intron 1 of <italic>ZC3H11A</italic> in all placental mammals for which at least a partial genome sequence is available. ZBED6 has evolved an essential function in this group as implicated by the observation that the two DNA-binding BED domains (about 100 amino acids together) show near 100&#x00025; amino acid identity across 26 placental mammals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000256.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The two BED domains in ZBED6 have apparently evolved by internal duplication because the two copies are more similar to each other than to any other mammalian BED sequence. The mechanism by which ZBED6 acts as a repressor remains to be determined. Chromatin remodeling is an obvious possibility since other members of the ZBED family have this function. For instance, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dref protein, a BED domain protein, is found in complex with the NURF chromatin remodeling complex and its human ortholog ZBED1 interacts with MI2, a chromatin remodeling factor, and PC2, a Polycomb group protein involved in heterochromatin formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Matsukage1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of ZBED6 to interact with chromatin and affect transcriptional regulation is most likely a function derived from the ancestral transposase. The nucleolar localization of ZBED6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000256-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) suggests that it may mediate transcriptional silencing by moving the <italic>IGF2</italic> locus and other targets to the nucleolus.</p><p>Our ChIP-sequencing experiment using mouse C2C12 myoblasts revealed more than 1,000 genes putatively regulated by ZBED6 in the mouse.

In this context, it is worth emphasizing that disruption of the interaction between ZBED6 and the <italic>IGF2</italic> QTN in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of <italic>IGF2</italic> mRNA in skeletal muscle and altered body composition. Interestingly, our data indicated that the <italic>Zbed6</italic> gene itself was bound by ZBED6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000256.s004">Table S1</xref>), implying autoregulation of its expression.</p><p>About 1,200 of the ZBED6 binding sites in C2C12 cells occurred within 5 kb of the TSS of an annotated gene.

It may appear surprising that genes associated with neurogenesis were much more overrepresented in our peak list than genes associated with muscle development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000256-g006">Figure 6E</xref>), given the fact that we used mouse C2C12 myoblasts in this experiment. However, this pattern is expected if ZBED6 is primarily a repressor that silence genes not being part of the developmental program of a certain cell type. Another intriguing observation was the clear trend that ZBED6 preferentially binds downstream of the transcription start site which appears logical for a repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000256-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p><italic>Igf2</italic> is an imprinted gene, but our list of top hits did not indicate any overrepresentation of imprinted genes. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the QTN mutation in pigs does not result in loss of imprinting, but rather exclusively increases the transcription from the paternal <italic>Igf2</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-VanLaere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, ZBED6 is unlikely to be a regulator of imprinting. However, one of the identified ZBED6 targets is the gene for growth factor receptor-bound protein (<italic>Grb10</italic>), also denoted <italic>Meg1</italic> (<italic>maternally expressed gene 1</italic>), that is maternally expressed and a potent growth inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Charalambous1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. GRB10 binds to the insulin receptor (INSR) and the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), and inhibits the growth-promoting activities of insulin (INS), IGF1, and IGF2.</p><p>The list of genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000256.s004">Table S1</xref>) includes additional members, besides <italic>Igf2</italic>, of the IGF-signaling pathway, namely the genes for the IGF1 receptor (<italic>Igf1r</italic>), IGF2 binding protein 2 (<italic>Igf2bp2</italic>), IGF binding protein 3 (<italic>Igfbp3</italic>), and IGFBP-like protein 1 (<italic>Igfbpl1</italic>), suggesting that ZBED6 is an important regulator of IGF signaling. Furthermore, <italic>Grb10</italic>, as mentioned above, also takes part in the regulation of IGF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Charalambous1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Genome Wide Association (GWA) studies have revealed a number of loci in the human genome associated with multifactorial disorders (Office of Population Genomics; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.gov/26525384">http://www.genome.gov/26525384</ext-link>). An examination of this database showed that the region harboring <italic>ZBED6</italic> is not one of the associated regions in any of the studies published so far. This means that the current GWA screens for different multifactorial disorders have not revealed any common <italic>ZBED6</italic> variants associated with disease. This does not exclude the possibility of rare sequence polymorphism in <italic>ZBED6</italic> affecting disease susceptibility in certain families. However, the ChIP-sequencing data indicated that ZBED6 has a fundamental role in regulating several biological processes. Mutations altering ZBED6 function or expression may therefore have severe pleiotropic effects through the many downstream targets. This notion is consistent with the near 100&#x00025; conservation of the BED domains among placental mammals.</p><p>Our current model for ZBED6 function is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000256-g007">Figure 7</xref>. Our data on the <italic>IGF2</italic> locus indicate that ZBED6 acts primarily as a repressor, likely with a modulating effect, although it is fully possible that it acts as a transcriptional activator under some circumstances.</p><fig id="pbio-1000256-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000256.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Proposed model for ZBED6 action.</title><p>ZBED6 repression may be released by (<italic>i</italic>) germline or somatic mutations at target sites, (<italic>ii</italic>) methylation (Me) of the CpG site in the binding motif, (<italic>iii</italic>) down-regulation of ZBED6 expression, or (<italic>iv</italic>) loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ZBED6</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000256.g007"/></fig><p>First, germline or somatic mutations at target sites may lead to transcriptional up-regulation as demonstrated for the <italic>IGF2</italic> locus in pigs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-VanLaere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings that the mammalian genome contains thousands of putative ZBED6 targets and that these are enriched among genes associated with disease suggest that sequence polymorphism at ZBED6 target sites may contribute significantly to variation in disease susceptibility in humans. Furthermore, the ZBED6 binding motif contains a CpG dinucleotide so we expect to find genetic polymorphisms as CpG sites are associated with a high rate of C&#x02192;T and G&#x02192;A transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Bird1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, as exemplified by the pig <italic>IGF2</italic> QTN. Gain or loss of ZBED6 binding sites may also have contributed to phenotypic evolution in placental mammals.</p><p>Second, our data suggest that ZBED6 targets can be released from repression by epigenetic activation. This is implied by the finding that EMSA using an oligonucleotide with a methylated CpG site was not bound by ZBED6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-VanLaere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the pig QTN had no effect on <italic>IGF2</italic> transcription in liver, and the QTN region was shown to be methylated in this tissue, whereas it was undermethylated in skeletal muscle where the QTN had a drastic effect on <italic>IGF2</italic> expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-VanLaere1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, epigenetic regulation of the access of ZBED6 to its target sites may play an important role during development and cell differentiation.</p><p>Third, ZBED6 targets can be released from repression by down-regulation of ZBED6 expression, as demonstrated by siRNA experiments in the present study. Finally, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ZBED6</italic> are expected to up-regulate many target genes. Our finding that <italic>Zbed6</italic> silencing in C2C12 cells leads to faster cell proliferation and wound healing combined with the identification of a large number of cancer-associated downstream targets by ChIP sequencing implies that further studies of ZBED6 function is of considerable interest for tumor biology.</p><p>Data reported here suggest that ZBED6 has an essential role in a number of crucial gene regulatory networks. Thus, the discovery of ZBED6 opens up many avenues for research that may have profound implications for human medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Proteomics</title><p>Two sets of murine C2C12 myoblast cells (ATCC CRL-1772) were used.

Alignment was done in two steps, first the AB pipeline (mapreads) was used to align full-length reads with up to four mismatches, and subsequently, the remaining reads was truncated to 35 bases and realigned with four mismatches using ZOOM! <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Lin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This gave 18&#x0002b;6.5 million uniquely placed alignments at 23 million unique positions. Each read was extended to 200 bases and overlap profiles were calculated to identify regions of enrichment. FindPeaks 3.1.92 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Fejes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> was used to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR), giving a probability of &#x0003c;0.001 at 15 overlapping fragments. Peaks falling within 100 kb of centromeric gaps or overlapping with Satellite and rRNA repeats were removed to reduce nonrandom false-positive peak calls. This gave 2,499 peaks, which were then associated with the nearest TSS and CpG island (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000256.s004">Table S1</xref>). We noted that the additional sonication done before sequencing gave larger regions with enrichment compared to what is normally seen in size-selected ChIP-seq dataset, therefore, we additionally filtered the peaks to contain only the highest scoring peak within 5 kb before performing de novo motif finding using BioProspector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Liu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We searched for motifs of length 8 bp both in the full list of peaks and in subsets of peaks divided by enrichment and location, and used mouse sequences 1 kb upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) as background. We used the DAVID software for Gene Ontology analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Huang1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000256-Dennis1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4p"><title>URL</title><p>Information on genomes is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ucsc.edu">http://www.genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000256.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of BED domains from the human ZBED family of proteins.</bold> Multiple copies of BED domains in an individual protein are indicated by a hyphen followed by a numeral.

Initial alignment of the corresponding DNA sequences revealed single nucleotide gaps/insertions in some sequences originating from the Whole-Genome-Shotgun Sequence database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link> (posted date October 24, 2008, 2:23 AM). These positions have been treated as sequence artifacts and have therefore been corrected to give a continuous reading frame before translating to protein sequence. A single nucleotide insertion has been removed from American pika and thirteen-lined ground squirrel. A missing base (N) has been introduced at codon 173 in alpaca and at codon 306 in northern tree shrew. The Gln-residue (Q) at position 131 in rock hyrax is possibly caused by two sequence errors (an insertion of a C followed by a deletion of an A), but remains unedited.
