Therefore, it is of interest to compare these two Hsp40 protein structures from different species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Both Hdj1 and Sis1 monomer structures contain domain I, domain II and the C-terminal dimerization motif. The individual domains from Hdj1 and Sis1 structure share similar folds.

When the domain II of Hdj11 is superimposed with that of the Sis1 structure, we found that the domain I of Hdj1 in the complex structure was kinked about 7.1&#x000b0; away from that in Sis1 structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The domain re-arrangements within Hdj1 were achieved by the rotation of the linker region between domain I and domain II (residues 242 to 249).</p><p>The domain arrangements between domain I and II of Hdj1 cause the two domain Is within the Hdj1 dimer closer to each other when compared with Sis1 structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This makes the cleft between two monomers within Hdj1 smaller than that of Sis1. The relative positions of the domain IIs and the C-terminal dimerization motifs within the Hdj1 and Sis1 homo-dimers, however, are kept almost the same when superimposed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The structural differences between Hdj1 and Sis1 structures indicate that the domain I of Hsp40 may possess significant flexibility. This flexibility may be important for Hsp40 to interact with non-native polypeptides and transfer them to Hsp70.</p><p>Another major difference between Hdj1 and Sis1 structure is at the tip region of the domain I. The sequence alignment indicates that human Hsp40 Hdj1 has five more amino acid residues between &#x003b2;-strand B2 and B3 than Sis1 from yeast, while Hdj1 has one fewer residue between &#x003b2;-strand B4 and B5 than Sis1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When the domain Is from Hdj1 and Sis1 structures are superimposed, we found that the loop between B2 and B3 in Hdj1 structure protrudes significantly further away than that in Sis1 structure. The longer loop region at the tip of domain I in the Hdj1 structure helps to constitute a larger domain I than that in Sis1 structure. Sequence alignment shows that the loop region between B2 and B3 is longest for human and mouse type II Hsp40 among all species. It is two amino acid residues shorter in <italic>C. elegans </italic>and <italic>Drosophila </italic>and five amino acid residues shorter in yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Sequence alignment of the C-terminal regions from eukaryotic Type II Hsp40 family members.

Because part of the electron density is missing for this loop region in Hdj1 structure, it is difficult for us to compare this region between Hdj1 and Sis1 structure. The sequence alignment indicates that only Sis1 from <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>has the longer loop between B4 and B5. All the other type II Hsp40s, however, contain the shorter version of the loop between B4 and B5.</p></sec><sec><title>The peptide-binding site of human Hsp40 Hdj1</title><p>Molecular chaperone Hsp40 can interact and stabilize the non-native polypeptides and prevent them from forming aggregations. The peptide-binding sites of both type I and type II Hsp40s for the non-native polypeptides have been located on the molecular surface of domain I. The Hsp40s may bind the non-native polypeptides through hydrophobic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When we examined the peptide-binding site on the domain I of Hdj1 structure, several hydrophobic residues were identified to participate in forming the peptide-binding site. These residues include L168, M183, I185 and F237 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The hydrophobicity of these residues is well conserved among all species. However, a polar residue, H166, was also identified to be involved in constituting the peptide-binding pocket (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This Histidine residue is conserved for type II Hsp40s among all species except for yeast as shown in sequence alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). We reason that H166 may play an important role in positioning the side chains from Pro, Phe or Tyr residues through van der waals interactions.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>The surface potential drawings around the Hdj1 and Sis1 peptide-binding sites determined by Swiss-PDBviewer.

It has been reported that Hsp40 may interact with the Hsp70 C-terminal EEVD motif by use of the peptide-binding site located on Hsp40 domain I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The crystal structure of yeast Hsp40 Sis1 and Hsp70 Ssa1 C-terminus complex indicated that several Lysine residues (K199, K202, K214 and K256) in Sis1 are involved in binding the Hsp70 C-terminal EEVD motif by charge-charge interactions. The sequence alignment shows that the corresponding residues in Hdj1 are K181, K184, R198 and K242. In the Hdj1 structure, K181, K184 and K242 are well-positioned to interact with the EEVD motif from Hsp70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). K181 and K242 are stabilized by forming salt bridges with a conserved E174. R198, however, points to the opposite direction from the peptide-binding site of Hdj1 and it is not likely to be involved in binding Hsp70 EEVD. K181, K184 and K242 are all conserved for type II Hsp40 among all species. Therefore these positively charged residues may be the common residues for type II Hsp40s to interact with the Hsp70 C-terminal EEVD motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We report the crystal structure of human type II Hsp40 Hdj1 putative peptide-binding fragment to 2.7&#x000c5; resolution. The structure reveals that Hdj1 forms a homo-dimer in the crystal by a crystallographic two-fold axis. The Hdj1 dimer has a U-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers. The human Hdj1 structure is similar to the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Hsp40 Sis1, which may account for the fact that Hdj1 and Sis1 share similar <italic>in vivo </italic>functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the two structures have significant differences. When compared with yeast type II Hsp40 Sis1 structure, the domain I of Hdj1 shows a 7.1&#x000b0; rotation from the main body of the molecule, which makes the cleft between two Hdj1 monomers smaller. In the crystal structure of Hdj1, a polar residue H166 is involved in forming the peptide-binding site, which is different from the hydrophobic peptide-binding depression revealed in Sis1 structure. In addition, at the tip of domain I in Hdj1 structure, Hdj1 structure has a longer loop region than Sis1, which accounts for a larger domain I in Hdj1 structure.</p><p>The domain re-arrangement between domain I and domain II within type II Hsp40 has been observed when yeast Hsp40 Sis1 binds the Hsp70 Ssa1 C-terminus. Little conformational changes occur within the individual domain I and domain II of Sis1 after binding to Ssa1. However, we found that the domain I of Sis1 in the complex structure was kinked about 8.5&#x000b0; away from that in Sis1 structure. These conformational changes widen up the cleft between the two Sis1 monomers within the homo-dimer, where might be the docking site for Ssa1 peptide-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, when we compare the crystal structures of Hdj1 and Sis1 peptide-binding fragment, we found that the domain Is within Hdj1 were swung towards each other by 7.1&#x000b0; from that in Sis1 structure, which makes the cleft between the two monomers smaller. These domain re-arrangements were achieved by the rotation of the linker region between domain I and domain II within both Sis1 and Hdj1 structures. The relative positions of the domain IIs within the Sis1 and Hdj1 dimer, however, are kept almost the same.</p><p>These structural observations indicate that domain I of Hsp40 may possess significant flexibility to take different conformations for its molecular chaperone activity. The flexibility in Sis1 could be important for the Hsp40/Hsp70 system to function. Previous studies have shown that the mutations within the interface of domain I and domain II in Sis1 can abolish the binding capability of Sis1 to Ssa1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is possible that the conformational changes of Sis1 can not be achieved within these mutants to locate the domain I of Sis1 into the Ssa1 binding position.</p><p>In the Sis1 structure, the peptide-binding site is occupied by a Pro residue from a neighbor molecule. It is possible that the Sis1 structure may represent the conformation for Sis1 to bind the non-native polypeptide. The Sis1-Ssa1 complex structure may represent the conformation for Sis1 to interact with Hsp70 Ssa1. The peptide-binding site in the Hdj1 structure is not occupied by any amino acid residue, so the Hdj1 structure may represent the free Hsp40 state. Thus, Hsp40 may take different conformations in these three states.</p><p>An "anchoring and docking" model for Hsp70 to interact with Hsp40 Sis1 has been proposed, in which the Hsp70 C-terminus may function as an anchor to bind to Hsp40 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The studies in this paper may add significant more details into the model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). When the Hsp40 is free of non-native polypeptides, it may keep a relatively small cleft within the dimer structure. The cleft may be widened up when Hsp40 binds the non-native polypeptide. The Hsp70 C-terminal anchor region may bind the Sis1 peptide-binding pocket and replace hydrophobic side chains from the non-native polypeptide. This may further widen up the cleft within Hsp40 homo-dimer. The freed non-native polypeptide may be bound by Hsp70 for subsequent protein folding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the "anchoring and docking" mechanism by which Hsp40 (green) delivers a non-native peptide (blue) to Hsp70 (yellow). The cartoon drawing depicts an Hsp70 molecule that is divided into its ATPase domain, peptide-binding groove and the lid domain. The J-domain and peptide-binding fragment of Hsp40 are shown schematically. The C-terminus "anchor" region of Hsp70 is shown in a red arrow. The blue line denotes the extended non-native polypeptide.

The small angel X-ray scattering studies indicated that the two J-domains within the type II Hsp40 dimer are positioned at two opposite ends. The relative positioning of Hsp70 N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain has also been revealed by X-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our working model is consistent with the results from previous structural studies.</p><p>It is not very clear what roles that the Hsp40 conformational changes may play when binding the non-native polypeptides in Hsp40/Hsp70 molecular chaperone functions. Several possibilities may exist. 1. Widening up the cleft while Hsp40 interacts with non-native polypeptides may help to stretch the polypeptides into extended conformations. Hsp70 prefers to bind the polypeptides in extended conformations. 2. The enlarged cleft within the Hsp40 homo-dimer may provide more space for Hsp70 to dock and to interact with the non-native polypeptides.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have determined the crystal structure of the putative peptide-binding fragment of Hdj1, a human member of the type II Hsp40 family. The 2.7&#x000c5; structure reveals that Hdj1 forms a homodimer in the crystal by a crystallographic two-fold axis. The Hdj1 dimer has a U-shaped architecture and a large cleft is formed between the two elongated monomers.</p><p>This structural observation indicates that the domain I of Hsp40 may possess significant flexibility. This flexibility may be important for Hsp40 to regulate the size of the cleft. We propose an "anchoring and docking" model for Hsp40 to utilize the flexibility of domain I to interact with non-native polypeptides and transfer them to Hsp70.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Crystallization of the Hdj1 putative peptide-binding fragment</title><p>We have cloned the human type II Hsp40 Hdj1 putative peptide-binding fragment (residues 158&#x02013;340). The recombinant protein was then expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>and purified by use of a Nickel-chelating column followed by a gel filtration column Superdex-75 (GE Healthcare). The protein was concentrated to 25 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), NaCl 50 mM. The Hdj1 putative peptide-binding fragment was crystallized by use of hanging drop vapor diffusion method with the mother liquid of 100 mM Citric acid buffer (pH 5.5), 25% PEG400 at room temperature.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>The diffraction data for the Hdj1 crystals were collect at APS beamline SERCAT. The crystals were flash frozen at 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream in the cryoprotectant consisting of 100 mM citric acid buffer (pH 5.5), 35% PEG400. The crystals diffracted to 2.7&#x000c5; using the X-ray at 1.0&#x000c5; wavelength. The data were processed by HKL2000 package. The crystals belong to the space group of C222<sub>1 </sub>with the cell parameters of a = 97.01&#x000c5;, b = 191.13 and c = 40.96&#x000c5;.</p><p>Program EPMR through the package SGXPRO was utilized to carry out the molecular replacement method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Sis1 peptide-binding fragment monomer structure was used as the searching model. The sequence identity between Sis1 and Hdj1 peptide-binding fragment is 33%. One clear solution was revealed through the search. The resultant electron density map allowed us to carry out the molecular tracing by use of the program O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The residues 162 to 335 of Hdj1 except for a short loop region (residues 228 to 230) were modeled into the electron density map.</p><p>The model was then refined by program CNS against the 2.7&#x000c5; data collected at APS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. One cycle of temperature annealing at 2000 K and six cycles of positional refinement were then carried out. Restrained individual B-factor refinement was not performed until the last cycle. After each cycle of refinement, the model was manually rebuilt according to the resultant 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps. The refinement gave reasonable R.M.S. derivation from the ideal geometry at this resolution (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The possible bias for Hdj1 structure determination generated by using Sis1 as a model is not very likely because we see clear side chains for Hdj1 molecule in the resultant electron density map. The R<sub>free </sub>is also within the reasonable range, which indicates the Hdj1 structure is correct.</p><p>A Ramachandran plot of the final model by use of program Probity revealed that 87.7% of the residues in the structure were in the favored regions and 97.2% of the residues were in allowed regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><sec><title>Coordinates</title><p>The coordinates and structure factors of Hdj1 putative peptide-binding fragment crystals have been deposited to Protein Data Bank with an accession number of 2QLD.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JH carried out the protein expression, purification and crystallization.
