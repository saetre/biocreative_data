SmpB is a tmRNA binding protein that has been identified to be essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vivo</italic>. To further study the function of SmpB, an S30 fraction from an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain, in which the set of genes for SmpB and tmRNA has been deleted from the genome, and His-tagged SmpB active in <italic>trans</italic>-translation were prepared. The SmpB-depleted S30 fraction had an ability to facilitate poly(U)-dependent tag-peptide synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> when purified His-tagged SmpB was exogenously added together with tmRNA, although SmpB was not required for <italic>in vitro</italic> poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis. It was also found that depletion of SmpB leads to a decrease in the level of tmRNA in the cell. In addition, SmpB considerably enhanced the aminoacylation of tmRNA by alanyl-tRNA synthetase <italic>in vitro</italic>. The aminoacylation enhancement by SmpB, the binding of SmpB to tmRNA and the effect of depletion of SmpB on the expression level of tmRNA in the cell were all affected by some mutations in the tRNA-like domain which cause a defect in ribosome binding leading to a <italic>trans</italic>-translation deficiency. These results demonstrate that, via binding to the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA, SmpB plays various roles: rescuing the tmRNA molecule from degradation in the cell, enhancing the aminoacylation of tmRNA and mediating the binding of tmRNA to ribosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA, also known as 10Sa RNA or SsrA RNA) is widely distributed among eubacteria, and has also been found in some chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c3">3</xref>).

This tRNA-like structure is supported by chemical and enzymatic probing studies as well as comparative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c10">10</xref>).

It has recently been shown that the <italic>trans</italic>-translation can also occur at the termination codon on a normal mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c19">19</xref>).</p><p>It has been proposed that the molecular interplay between these two functions of this molecule facilitates an unusual translation reaction&#x02014;<italic>trans</italic>-translation&#x02014;in which a ribosome can switch from the translation of a truncated mRNA to the tag-encoded sequence of tmRNA. This would relieve stalled translation from mRNAs lacking a stop codon or possessing a cluster of rare codons with the addition of a specific tag-peptide as a degradation signal to the truncated C-termini of polypeptides decoded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c21">21</xref>). A series of these processes may promote recycling of ribosomes as well as prevent accumulation of abortively synthesized polypeptides, providing some advantage to the cell for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c23">23</xref>). The <italic>trans</italic>-translation model has also been supported by several other findings showing that the function as a tRNA is a prerequisite for the function as an mRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c18">18</xref>), that an amino acid aminoacylated to tmRNA is actually incorporated into the tag-peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c24">24</xref>) and that tmRNA binds predominantly to 70S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c25">25</xref>) but scarcely to polysome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c26">26</xref>).</p><p>According to the <italic>trans</italic>-translation, the first GCA codon for tag-peptide should be settled on the A-site after the first translocation event. It has been shown <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> that several nucleotides upstream of the tag-encoding region are important for efficient and correct initiation of tag-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>). In addition, the first pseudoknot (PK1) 12 nt upstream of the tag-initiation point, but not the other three pseudoknots (PK2&#x02013;PK4) downstream of the tag-encoding region, has been shown to be important for efficient tag-translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c30">30</xref>). However, any intermolecular or intramolecular interactions with these <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences and structures on tmRNA should be required to reasonably explain the mechanism underlying resumption of translation at the definite position on tmRNA.</p><p>Recently, the small basic protein SmpB, the gene of which is located immediately upstream of the tmRNA gene on the genome, has been identified in <italic>E.coli</italic> as a tmRNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c31">31</xref>), and it is included in the complex involving tmRNA and several other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c32">32</xref>). Among these protein factors, SmpB is the only one that has been shown to be essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation. The depletion of SmpB causes an unsuccessful binding of tmRNA to ribosome leading to the failure of <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vivo</italic>, although the mode of interaction between SmpB and tmRNA has yet to be identified.</p><p>In the present study, we focused on the role of SmpB in the processes of <italic>trans</italic>-translation.

Essentially the same patterns were obtained, when SmpB was detected using the anti-His-tag antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that the His-tagged SmpB made a complex with tmRNA in the mixture.</p><p>Using this system, we examined the SmpB binding property of 3A mutant having a G&#x02192;A mutation at position 3 which has no capacity of aminoacylation due to the lack of the identity determinant for alanyl-tRNA synthetase.

Among them, we selected four single-point mutants named 19C, 62C, 86C and 334U, to examine the effects of mutations on the complex formation with SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>M). Each of 19C and 334U having a G&#x02192;C mutation at 19 and an A&#x02192;U mutation at 334, respectively, completely damages the <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c36">36</xref>). 62C having a G&#x02192;C mutation at position 62 in PK1 decreases the <italic>in vitro trans</italic>-translation efficiency to less than half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c29">29</xref>), and 86C having an A&#x02192;C mutation at 86, 4 nt upstream of the tag-initiation point, completely damages the <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>). Each mutation causes serious damage to <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vitro</italic>, but does not affect the aminoacylation. We examined the complex formation with SmpB for these mutants by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. It was found that both 62C and 86C mutants made a complex with SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>F and G), whereas 19C and 334U mutants did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>E and H).

Under excess alanyl-tRNA synthetase (8.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;2</sup> U), the plateau level of aminoacylation reached only &#x0223c;50&#x00025; in the absence of SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>A). The low level of aminoacylation plateau has also been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c13">13</xref>), and it was not attributed to the contamination of nucleases in alanyl-tRNA synthetase, because of no detectable degradation of the tmRNA band on the gel after prolonged incubation of the reaction and an unchanged level of aminoacylation plateau after prolonged preincubation without amino acid (data not shown). Interestingly, the plateau level was increased with increasing amount of SmpB and it reached 75&#x00025; in the presence of 4 &#x000b5;M SmpB. Under the limited concentration of alanyl-tRNA synthetase (8.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> U), the effect of SmpB was more obvious (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>B). The aminoacylation efficiency at 12&#x000a0;min in the presence of 4 &#x000b5;M SmpB was &#x0223c;5-fold higher than that in the absence of SmpB. As a control molecule aminoacylatable with alanine, tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> from <italic>E.coli</italic> was examined. In contrast to the case for tmRNA, the aminoacylation efficiency of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> was unchanged by the addition of SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>K).</p><p>We examined the effect of SmpB on aminoacylation for the <italic>trans</italic>-translation deficient mutants described above. As already reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c29">29</xref>), aminoacylation of 62C and 86C mutants occurs to a similar extent as that for wild-type tmRNA in the absence of SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>A, D and E). The aminoacylation for 62C and 86C mutants was considerably enhanced by the addition of SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>D and E) in a manner similar to that for wild-type tmRNA. pK2L, pK3L and pK4L mutants are efficiently aminoacylated, whereas pK1L has a significantly reduced aminoacylation ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c37">37</xref>). The enhancement of aminoacyation by SmpB was observed in these pseudoknot mutant tmRNAs, even in pK1L (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>G&#x02013;I). In contrast, no significant enhancement was observed for 19C and 334U mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f4">4</xref>C and F), which does not bind to SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>E and H). Thus, the enhancement of aminoacylation by SmpB was observed only in the tmRNA mutants which can make a complex with SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>E&#x02013;H). These results indicate that SmpB has a role in the enhancement of aminoacylation of tmRNA via binding to G<sub>19</sub> and A<sub>334</sub> and&#x0002f;or their close proximities, and that a defect in the normal binding between tmRNA and SmpB abolishes the enhancement of the aminoacylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding to SmpB increases the level of tmRNA in the cell</title><p>We compared the expression level of tmRNA between the SmpB-depleted cells (&#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic>) and the SmpB-containing cells (&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic>). A pMW119-based low copy number plasmid carrying the tmRNA gene under the native promoter sequence was transformed into these two strains. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the expression level of tmRNA in the &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells was comparable to that in the cell of parental strain (data not shown). In contrast, the amount of tmRNA in the &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells reduced &#x0223c;4-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f5">5</xref>A and B). As a control, 5S ribosomal RNA was tested, and no significant difference in the amount between the two strains was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f5">5</xref>E).</p><p>Next we examined the effect of depletion of SmpB on the expression levels of tmRNA mutants 3A, 19C and 334U. We prepared pMW119-based low copy number plasmids each carrying tmRNA mutant gene under the native promoter sequence, and then transformed them into &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells. The difference between the two strains was similarly observed for 3A mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f5">5</xref>B), which has no aminoacylation ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c18">18</xref>). The expression level of 19C or 334U mutants in the presence of SmpB was apparently lower than that of wild-type or 3A mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D). Furthermore, the levels of these two mutant tmRNAs were not affected by SmpB, in contrast to the wild-type and 3A tmRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f5">5</xref>A&#x02013;D). Thus, the difference in expression levels between the two strains was observed only in the tmRNA mutants capable of binding SmpB. The results strongly suggest that the observed effect is not a result of a regulation at the transcription level and that SmpB functions to rescue tmRNA from degradation by nucleases via binding to tmRNA in the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Karzai <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c31">31</xref>) have shown that SmpB is a tmRNA binding protein that has been identified to be essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vivo</italic>, and its depletion affects the binding of tmRNA to ribosome. Their overproduced SmpB has a high affinity to tmRNA, although with no information about the <italic>trans</italic>-translation activity. In the present study, we made an SmpB- and tmRNA-depleted strain &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic>. Using this strain, we first confirmed that SmpB is essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation, but not for canonical translation <italic>in vitro</italic>. The strain &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> in addition to another tmRNA-depleted strain &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> allowed us to evaluate the <italic>trans</italic>-translation activity of SmpB <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as the effect of SmpB in combination with the mutation of tmRNA <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using this system, we confirmed that the overproduced His-tagged SmpB is active in both tmRNA binding and <italic>trans</italic>-translation. This active SmpB considerably enhanced the aminoacylation activity of tmRNA. It was also found that the expression level of tmRNA is significantly reduced in the SmpB-depleted cell. In addition, the present <italic>in vitro</italic> study supports an earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c31">31</xref>) indicating that SmpB has a role to facilitate the binding to the ribosome. SmpB might be a direct mediator to recruit tmRNA into the ribosome. Alternatively, SmpB only induces a conformation change of tmRNA so that tmRNA can enter the ribosome.</p><p>Here, three functions of SmpB have been established: SmpB rescues the tmRNA molecule from degradation in the cell, enhances aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase and facilitates the binding of tmRNA to the ribosome. All of these functions were found to be affected by some single-point mutations in the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA which also affect the binding of SmpB to tmRNA (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkf246tb1">1</xref>). Conversely, the binding of SmpB was still observed in any mutant in which SmpB protects from degradation in the cell or enhances aminoacylation. This clearly indicates that these functions are mediated by the binding of SmpB to the lower portion of the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that the aminoacylation capacity of tmRNA is significantly poor as compared with that of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c24">24</xref>). The present study demonstrates that pre-aminoacylated tmRNA is not optimal for recognition by alanyl-tRNA synthetase and that SmpB has a high affinity to pre-aminoacylated tmRNA to elevate the aminoacylation efficiency to a considerable extent. A large population of tmRNA in the cell may form a complex with SmpB prior to aminoacylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f6">6</xref>): this is supported by the present findings that the non-aminoacylatable 3A mutant can form a complex with SmpB and that it is protected from degradation by SmpB in the cell to an extent comparable with the case for wild-type tmRNA. SmpB may interact with the tRNA-like region of non-aminoacylated tmRNA to modulate the conformation of the tRNA-like domain more suitable for recognition by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f6">6</xref>). An earlier study has shown that His-tagged SmpB has no effect on aminoacylation of the transcript of tmRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c31">31</xref>), which is in sharp contrast with the present results. We have no idea whether this discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that their SmpB was purified from an inclusion body via a procedure of denaturation by 3 M guanidium hydrochloride. We can at least rule out the possibility that the observed aminoacylation enhancement <italic>in vitro</italic> was due to the protection of tmRNA by SmpB from degradation by nucleases in the alanyl-tRNA synthetase of our preparation.</p><p>The lower half of the tRNA-like domain encompassing 13&#x02013;21 and 332&#x02013;335 are highly conserved, and our recent study has shown that several base substitutions in this region affect the <italic>trans</italic>-translation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c36">36</xref>). In particular, 19C and 334U, single-point mutations at the strictly conserved positions at 19 and 334, respectively, severely damaged the binding to the ribosome leading to a defect in <italic>trans</italic>-translation, whereas it did not affect aminoacylation by alanyl-tRNA synthetase at all. Note that both positions are in the tRNA-like domain, but apart from the internal coding region. The present study reveals that the defect in the ribosome binding caused by each mutation is attributed to the unsuccessful interaction with SmpB. It has been proposed that G<sub>19</sub> and A<sub>334</sub> together with A<sub>20</sub> and G<sub>333</sub> form an AG:GA sheared base pair, a characteristic RNA structure found in hammerhead ribozyme and in ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c38">38</xref>). Considering that either mutation at 19 or 334 induces only a minor change of the local conformation of the tmRNA molecule, SmpB may interact with these nucleotides directly or in close proximity of them. These positions are close to the area of interaction with alanyl-tRNA synthetase, which primarily covers the acceptor helix leading to the 3&#x02032;-CCA terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c41">41</xref>), and is extended to the D-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c43">43</xref>) and the anticodon stem in tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c43">43</xref>). The present results indicate that SmpB and alanyl-tRNA synthetase bind tmRNA cooperatively rather than in a mutually exclusive manner.</p><p>It has recently been shown that SmpB can form a complex with tmRNA and other proteins including a small subunit ribosomal protein S1, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase, RNase R and YfbG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c32">32</xref>). Among them, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthase and RNase R are not essential for <italic>trans</italic>-translation. S1 can interact with PK2, PK3 and PK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c44">44</xref>), although S1 is not universal among prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c45">45</xref>). The present results indicate that SmpB does not bind any of PK1, PK2, PK3 and PK4. Therefore, SmpB and S1 would be capable of binding to a tmRNA molecule simultaneously (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f6">6</xref>), as mentioned in Wower <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c44">44</xref>).</p><p>The 19C or 334U mutation, which seriously affects binding to SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>), has no longer ribosome binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c36">36</xref>). In contrast, the 86C mutation 4 nt upstream of the tag-initiation point, which does not affect binding to SmpB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf246f3">3</xref>), retains the capability of binding to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>). These findings, together with an earlier <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c31">31</xref>) and the present <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> results showing that depletion of SmpB seriously affects the ribosome binding capacity of tmRNA, support the idea that SmpB has a crucial role in recruitment of tmRNA to the ribosome. However, the behavior of SmpB during the ribosomal processes has yet to be characterized. The 86C mutation seriously damages the <italic>trans</italic>-translation due to some defect in the ribosomal processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>). U<sub>86</sub>, together with A<sub>87</sub> and G<sub>88</sub>, has been shown <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> to serve as a core nucleotide to determine the tag-resuming position, and thus it might be a recognition site of some <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf246c28">28</xref>). Although the present results indicate that SmpB does not interact with this core nucleotide at least in solution, it is possible that a conformation change of the tmRNA&#x02013;SmpB complex in the ribosome induces the contact between the core nucleotides and SmpB. Further studies about such a conformation change in the ribosome or another molecule possibly interacting with SmpB as well as the conformation of tmRNA complexed with SmpB are required to rationalize the elaborate interplay between the two apparently distant domains during the ribosomal processes.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf246f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Poly(U)-dependent alanine incorporation using the S30 fractions from &#x00394;<italic>smpB</italic>&#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells with (squares) and without (circles) plasmid-encoded SmpB and from &#x00394;<italic>ssrA</italic> cells (diamonds) in the presence of exogenous tmRNA.
