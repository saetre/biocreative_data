Paraoxonase-1 (PON1), an enzyme associated with high-density lipoprotein particles, participates both in the hydrolysis of oxidized lipids (thus protecting against atherosclerosis) and in the hydrolysis of organophosphates. Higher paraoxonase activity has been associated with lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>In this study we characterized the distribution of the functional <italic>PON1</italic><sub>Q192R</sub> polymorphisms (PON status as assessed by diazoxonase to paraoxonase ratios) and the PON1 activity levels in 200 adult males and females of both races (50 in each race/sex class) from the southern United States from commercially obtained blood bank serum samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used spectrophotometric methods with serum to determine PON1 status, arylesterase activities (phenyl acetate hydrolysis), and levels of cotinine and C-reactive protein (CRP).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>African Americans had higher paraoxonase activities but lower diazoxonase activities than did Caucasians, consistent with African Americans having a lower proportion of the functional genotype QQ (QQ 15%, QR 34%, RR 44%, 7% indeterminate), than did Caucasians (QQ 60%, QR 31%, RR 7%, 2% indeterminate).

PON1 is synthesized primarily in the liver and is secreted into the blood, where it is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ehp-117-1226">Deakin et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ehp-117-1226">James and Deakin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ehp-117-1226">Sorenson et al. 1999</xref>). PON1 belongs to a family of calcium-dependent lactonases/hydrolases that also include PON2 and PON3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp-117-1226">Gaidukov et al. 2006</xref>). The three enzymes hydrolyze aromatic and long-chain aliphatic lactones, but PON2 and PON3 lack paraoxonase (POase; phosphotriesterase) and arylesterase (phenyl acetate hydrolysis) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>). Lactones, such as those formed from the enzymatic and nonenzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid and docosa-hexaenoic acid, are the endogenous substrates of PON1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ehp-117-1226">Draganov et al. 2005</xref>). PON1&#x02019;s physiologic activity is thought to be that of a lipolactonase whose activity results in the prevention of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp-117-1226">Gaidukov et al. 2006</xref>). PON1 prevents the formation of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and protects phospholipids in HDLs from oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>PON1</italic> gene contains a variety of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter and the coding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ehp-117-1226">Chen et al. 2005</xref>). Previously, the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>Q192R</sub> polymorphism in the coding sequence was thought to influence susceptibility to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>). The <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> polymorphism affects PON1&#x02019;s hydro lytic activity toward several nonphysiologic substrates and thus was thought to influence its ability to protect against LDL oxidation. The Q alloform was believed to be more protective of cardiovascular health than the R alloform because it had a greater capacity to metabolize oxidized lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>). However, a meta-analysis of 43 published studies revealed only a very weak association of the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> polymorphism with coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ehp-117-1226">Wheeler et al. 2004</xref>) and concluded the association was of uncertain significance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ehp-117-1226">Gaidukov et al. (2006)</xref> reported that the R alloform of PON1 bound HDL with a higher affinity than did the Q alloform and thus exhibited increased stability and lipolactonase activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ehp-117-1226">Bhattacharyya et al. (2008)</xref> found patients with the QQ genotype had an increased incidence of major cardiac events. Others have reported no association of PON1 genotype with CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ehp-117-1226">Gardemann et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ehp-117-1226">Ombres et al. 1998</xref>). Thus, the association, if any, of the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> polymorphism with atherosclerosis remains uncertain. Other studies have shown an association of lower POase activity with atherosclerotic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ehp-117-1226">Ayub et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ehp-117-1226">Jarvik et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ehp-117-1226">Mackness et al. 2001</xref>), thus demonstrating the importance of determining the phenotype (i.e., actual enzyme activity or enzyme concentration) and not just the genotype when studying atherosclerosis. Therefore the continued investigation of both genotype and phenotype in more populations at risk of CVD is warranted.</p><p>Plotting the rates of diazoxon hydrolysis [diazoxonase (DZOase)] versus paraoxon hydrolysis (POase) (i.e., DZOase/POase ratio) separates individuals into three functional genotypes of PON1 activity: <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192QQ</sub>, <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192QR</sub>, and <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192RR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp-117-1226">Richter and Furlong 1999</xref>). However, both genotype and phenotype (i.e., overall PON1 activity) are important for determining the relationship of PON1 polymorphisms with susceptibilities to disease, sensitivity to organophosphate insecticides, and pharmacokinetic status of drug metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ehp-117-1226">Richter et al. 1999</xref>). Because arylesterase activity, using phenyl acetate as the substrate instead of the more toxic organophosphates as substrates, is frequently monitored as an index of PON1 activity, we also determined arylesterase activity in this study.</p><p>The significance of PON1 to cardiovascular health and sensitivity to organophosphate insecticides has been addressed experimentally through the use of <italic>PON1</italic> knockout mice, which were more susceptible to atherosclerosis, had HDL and LDL particles that were more susceptible to <italic>in vitro</italic> oxidation, and had HDL particles that were inefficient for hydrolysis of oxidized LDL particles <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ehp-117-1226">Shih et al. 1998</xref>). HDL particles isolated from transgenic mice with human PON1 had an enhanced ability to protect LDL particles from oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ehp-117-1226">Tward et al. 2002</xref>).</p><p>The southern United States (except Florida) has higher annual age-adjusted mortality rates from CVD (e.g., coronary heart disease and stroke) than do other regions of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ehp-117-1226">American Heart Association 2005</xref>), and African Americans have higher annual age-adjusted mortality rates of CVD than do Caucasians. The well-characterized critical risk factors for CVD are hypertension, dyslipidemias (e.g., high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol), smoking, diabetes mellitus, a family history of disease, and obesity. Several theories have been advanced to explain the higher stroke mortality rate in the South, including low socioeconomic status, an increased prevalence of severity of hypertension, and the presence of environmental toxicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ehp-117-1226">Perry and Rocella 1998</xref>). Data on the frequency distribution of <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> genotypes have been reported on numerous populations, but not specifically the American southern populations, which have the worst American health statistics. Previous studies reported that African Americans have a weighted <italic>PON1</italic><sub>Q192</sub> allele frequency of 0.37 and a weighted <italic>PON1</italic><sub>R192</sub> allele frequency of 0.63, whereas Caucasians have a weighted <italic>PON1</italic><sub>Q192</sub> allele frequency of 0.73 and a weighted <italic>PON1</italic><sub>R192</sub> allele frequency of 0.27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp-117-1226">Chen et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp-117-1226">Scacchi et al. 2003</xref>). Knowledge of PON1 enzymatic activities as related to genotype, phenotype, race, sex, and age within a population may provide a useful explanation for some of the disparities in CVD among demographic groups.</p><p>To characterize the functional genotype distribution (as assessed by DZOase/POase ratios) and activity levels of PON1 as contributors to the higher CVD in southern populations, in the present study we investigated PON1 activity levels with three substrates (paraoxon, diazoxon, and phenyl acetate) in the serum of African-American and Caucasian southerners within race, sex, and age groups. In addition, we also investigated the levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine (as a possible influence of cigarette smoking on PON1 activity and concentrations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ehp-117-1226">James et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ehp-117-1226">Nishio and Watanabe 1997</xref>) and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP), a biomarker for increased risk of coronary heart disease (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ehp-117-1226">Casas et al. 2008</xref>). Our study samples came from a commercial vendor that had obtained serum samples from blood banks in Alabama and Tennessee. We obtained a total of 200 serum samples from adult men and women in equally distributed race and sex classes who self-identified as being Caucasian or African American. With the data obtained, we observed that African Americans in the South have lower DZOase activities, higher POase activities, and lower DZOase/POase ratios than Caucasians, reflecting the significantly different distribution of QQ, QR, and RR functional genotypes observed in African Americans than that found in Caucasians. Our laboratory is expanding these studies at present with samples from individuals whose cardiovascular health status is known to determine what role the difference in frequency distribution of QQ, QR, and RR functional genotypes and differences in activity levels between the racial groups may play in the CVD health disparities observed and to investigate the associations that might exist with exposure to environmental chemicals.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and samples</title><p>We purchased all biochemicals from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO).

We incubated paraoxon (1.2 mM final concentration; stock solution in dry ethanol) in paired serum samples of 1 &#x003bc;L serum in a reaction volume of 200 &#x003bc;L. A calcium buffer solution of Tris-HCl (0.1 M, pH 8.0), 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 M NaCl was used to activate PON1 in one set of triplicate samples made from the same three independent dilutions of serum. We used an EDTA buffer solution with 1 mM EDTA instead of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to eliminate PON1 activity in the paired set of triplicate samples made from three independent dilutions of serum. After mixing and incubation at 37&#x000b0;C for 5 min, paraoxon was added, mixed, and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 20 min with shaking. After incubation, the enzyme reactions were terminated by adding a solution of 50 &#x003bc;L of 20 mM EDTA plus 2% Tris base solution in deionized water. The 4-nitrophenol released was quantified at 405 nm. We subtracted the mean of the EDTA triplicates from the mean of the CaCl<sub>2</sub> triplicates for each individual to correct for non-PON1-mediated hydrolysis. Data were expressed as micromoles of paraoxon hydrolyzed per minute per liter of serum.

We found no significant association between POase and CRP levels or DZOase and CRP levels.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism at position 192 has been proposed to have a significant effect on PON1 hydrolytic activity, xenobiotic metabolism, and the onset of CVD, with the R alloform earlier considered to be associated with vascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ehp-117-1226">Harel et al. 2004</xref>). Despite the fact that southerners (except Floridians) in general and African Americans in particular have higher annual age-adjusted mortality rates from CVD than do people in other regions of the United States, data on the distribution of <italic>PON1</italic><sub>Q192R</sub> in the serum of Caucasians and African Americans in the South have not been documented.</p><p>In the present study we determined the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> functional genotype distribution (as assessed by DZOase/POase ratios) and PON1 enzymatic activities (paraoxon and diazoxon hydrolysis, phenyl acetate hydrolysis) in the serum of 200 African-American and Caucasian southerners. We assumed that the individuals sampled from Alabama and Tennessee blood banks were residents of the South and therefore representative of southerners in general. This study revealed significant differences in the functional <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> genotype distribution between Caucasians and African Americans. Caucasians had an overwhelmingly higher distribution of the functional QQ genotype (60%) than did African Americans (15%). Our study agrees with results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp-117-1226">Chen et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ehp-117-1226">Scacchi et al. (2003)</xref>, who reported that African Americans have a higher R allele frequency (0.63) and Caucasians have a higher Q allele frequency (0.73). However these two studies did not report the activity level (phenotype), which is ultimately more important in functional capacity to hydrolyze oxidized lipids.</p><p>The arylesterase activity plot, where phenyl acetate was substituted for diazoxon, did not yield as straightforward a separation of functional genotypes as did the paraoxon versus diazoxon plot. Most laboratories report on aryl esterase activity using phenyl acetate, probably because of the high cost, toxicity, and instability of diazoxon. However, phenyl acetate is not as useful as the toxic organophosphate substrate for characterization of PON1 status. Although the African Americans had a significantly lower mean DZOase activity than did Caucasians, the lower activity of African Americans with phenyl acetate was not statistically significant. Probably because of the low numbers after the population was divided into functional genotypes, we found a trend within the QQ functional genotype (not statistically significant) that Caucasians had higher DZOase activity; this suggests that phenotype is important in characterizing risk factors and indicates that more research with larger groups of known cardiovascular health status would be useful.</p><p>Much of the difference in DZOase and POase activities between the races probably resulted from the difference in the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> genotype distribution; however, racial differences in other genotypic influences (e.g., promoter polymorphisms that influence expression) and in environmental and lifestyle influences, (e.g., diet, statins and other drugs, exposure to environmental factors) also probably contribute to the difference. However, the cotinine levels indicated that none of the serum samples came from smokers, so smoking was not an influence on the PON1 levels measured.</p><p>Differences in PON1 activities between the sexes have not been shown to be significant in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ehp-117-1226">Mueller et al. 1983</xref>). Results from our study also do not indicate a significant difference when comparing DZOase and POase activities of females and males separately or within each race.</p><p>In the present study we found that with age, POase activity appeared to decrease in females but increase in males, whereas DZOase activity did not change significantly with age in either sex. The difference in POase activity just reaches significance but is likely the result of uneven sampling of functional genotypes within the various age ranges, as mentioned in the &#x0201c;Results.&#x0201d; This interpretation emphasizes the need to consider potential confounders (in this case, functional genotype sampling disparities among age classes) when drawing conclusions about differences in activity levels among groups of individuals. Other studies have shown that serum PON1 activity is lower during development and at birth but increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ehp-117-1226">Chen et al. 2003</xref>). PON1 activities have also been reported to remain constant during adulthood or decrease in elderly subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ehp-117-1226">Costa et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ehp-117-1226">Jarvik et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ehp-117-1226">Milochevitch and Khalil 2001</xref>).</p><p>The individuals sampled here did not appear to be smokers, as indicated by the low cotinine levels. Although we do not know whether the blood banks screened out smokers, it would be highly unlikely to obtain 200 random samples with no smokers among them by chance. Because smoking can affect PON1 levels, we can assume that this potential factor did not influence the PON1 activity levels measured here. Certainly other xenobiotics may have influenced the activity levels, but we had no knowledge of drugs (e.g., statins) or environmental chemicals to which these individuals may have been exposed.</p><p>Although we did not know the health status of the individuals in this study, we did determine CRP concentrations as a biomarker of inflammation and CVD. We did not include individuals with CRP levels &#x0003e; 10 mg/L in these calculations because recommendations of the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest excluding these CRP concentrations from clinical decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ehp-117-1226">Pearson et al. 2003</xref>). We found that females had higher CRP concentrations than did males (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and that African Americans had higher CRP concentrations than did Caucasians (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These results on sex and race are consistent with literature reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ehp-117-1226">Kelley-Hedgepeth et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ehp-117-1226">Lakoski et al. 2006</xref>). CRP is influenced by modifiable risk factors such as body mass index, exogenous estrogen, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcohol use, HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, aspirin use, physical activity, LDL, and HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ehp-117-1226">Cushman et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ehp-117-1226">Ridker et al. 1999</xref>). However, we have no information regarding these factors in our study population.</p><p>One potential confounder worth noting is the potential inaccuracy of the self-identification of race. Although individuals may be primarily one race, in many cases there has been racial mixing in the past that may or may not be known to the individuals, so the racial designation may not have been totally accurate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this article we report the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> functional genotype distribution, PON1 enzymatic activities (POase, DZOase, and arylesterase), and mean DZOase/POase ratios in the serum of African-American and Caucasian southerners, along with the CRP and cotinine levels of these individuals. Most important, we found significant racial differences in the <italic>PON1</italic><sub>192</sub> functional genotype distribution, with African Americans&#x02014;the race with higher CVD&#x02014;displaying a greater proportion of the functional RR genotype. Although, at present, the relationship of the functional genotypes to CVD is equivocal, our data support the hypothesis that the functional RR genotype is less protective of cardiovascular health. These data suggest that further study using samples of southerners from both races&#x02014;where cardio vascular health status, lifestyle, and environmental influences are known&#x02014;would be of value in characterizing risk of both CVD and susceptibility to organophosphate insecticide toxicity. In addition, determining the complete <italic>PON1</italic> genotype (i.e., determining the promoter and protein polymorphisms) and quantitation of PON1 expression would allow the evaluation of what factors other than genotype contribute to the differences in PON1 activity observed between Caucasians and African Americans. Our laboratory is currently engaged in such a study with southerners of both races and both sexes where the presence of CVD and any therapeutic interventions are known.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We thank S.
