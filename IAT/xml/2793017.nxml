It is hitherto the only known mammalian transcription factor that regulates hypertonic stress-induced gene transcription. In addition, unlike other monomeric members of the NFAT family, OREBP exists as a homodimer and it is the only transcription factor known to bind naked DNA targets by complete encirclement <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, how OREBP interacts with target DNA, also known as ORE/TonE, and how it elicits gene transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, remains unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Using hypertonic induction of the aldose reductase (AR) gene activation as a model, we showed that OREs contained dynamic nucleosomes. Hypertonic stress induced a rapid and reversible loss of nucleosome(s) around the OREs. The loss of nucleosome(s) was found to be initiated by an OREBP-independent mechanism, but was significantly potentiated in the presence of OREBP. Furthermore, hypertonic induction of AR gene was associated with an OREBP-dependent hyperacetylation of histones that spanned the 5&#x02032; upstream sequences and at least some exons of the gene. Nevertheless, nucleosome loss was not regulated by the acetylation status of histone.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Our findings offer novel insights into the mechanism of OREBP-dependent transcriptional regulation and provide a basis for understanding how histone eviction and transcription factor recruitment are coupled.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Exposure of mammalian cells to hypertonic stress induces osmotically obliged water efflux that results in cell shrinkage.

However, eukaryotic DNA is wound around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, and the nucleosomes are further packaged into highly compacted chromatin structures. Consistent with these observations, emerging evidence has suggested that chromatin also plays an active role in the regulation of gene expression.

Herein we examined the role of nucleosomes in OREBP-mediated gene transcription. By studying hypertonic induction of the AR gene, we show that hypertonic stress induced eviction of one or more nucleosomes specifically at the genomic region containing the OREs. Interestingly, while nucleosome eviction could be initiated in the absence of OREBP, maximal nucleosome eviction was observed only in the presence of the transcription factor. Furthermore, we also observed that hypertonic stress induced histone acetylation that spanned the 5&#x02032; upstream sequences and the exons of the AR gene in an OREBP-dependent manner, implicating that histone acetylation has a role in AR gene activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Cultures</title><p>HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, penicillin and streptomycin.

It is therefore plausible that the observed reduction in the levels of acetylated histone at the OREBP-binding sites might have resulted from nucleosome depletion <italic>per se</italic> in response to hypertonic induction. We hence analyzed the chromatin structure over a region of 8 kb encompassing regions upstream and downstream of the <italic>AR</italic> promoter. A nucleosome consists of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). We first examined histone H3 occupancy after hypertonic stress by ChIP followed by quantitative PCR amplification of four amplicons that, in addition to the AR<sub>ORE</sub>, spread across a 8 kb region of the gene, including a -3.5 kb intergenic region (AR<sub>INTER</sub>), a proximal promoter (AR<sub>PP</sub>), and an exon 2 (gene body) region (AR<sub>EX2</sub>) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, we observed the depletion of histone H3 specifically at the locus of the OREs, whereas histone integrity at the other three loci was not altered significantly by hypertonic stress. Histone loss was observed at 5 min after hypertonic treatment and was reduced maximally by five-fold at 60 min. Hypertonic treatment for 120 min did not lead to further reduction of histone H3. Similarly, the quantities of histone H2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and histone H4 (data not shown) at the same locus were reduced at a rate and magnitude comparable to that of histone H3, suggesting that whole nucleosome located over the ORE region of <italic>AR</italic> was depleted in response to hypertonic stress. Notably, the level of histone H3 could be brought back to normal level when cells were returned to isotonic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), suggesting that nucleosome integrity could be restored upon removal of stress. On the other hand, when ChIP was conducted using anti-OREBP antibody, we showed that OREBP was rapidly recruited to the ORE <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to hypertonic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

To elucidate the role of histone acetylation in nucleosome eviction, we examined if trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, promotes nucleosome eviction in the absence of hypertonic stress. In the event, TSA promoted acetylation of histone H4 over the ORE and the intergenic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008435-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

This model was supported by <italic>in vivo</italic> studies demonstrating that the binding of Pho4 to PHO5 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Adkins1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Boeger1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, the binding of progesterone receptor to mouse mammary tumor virus promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Vicent1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as the recruitment of NFAT and c-Rel to the proximal promoter of interleukin-2 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Chen1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>, resulted in nucleosome evictions. Contrary to the existing paradigm, our data suggested that hypertonic stress-induced nucleosome eviction at the ORE locus did not require the recruitment of OREBP. Instead, in response to hypertonic stress, nucleosomes at or flanking the ORE sites were evicted before interacting with OREBP. It is possible that the eviction was mediated by some chromatin remodeling factors located in proximity to the ORE, which might response rapidly to the hypertonic signal.</p><p>What is the biological significance of the ORE region being associated with dynamic nucleosomes? We speculate that such a regulatory mechanism may have evolved along with the first appearance of OREBP in flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Graef1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. OREBP is distinctive from other known transcription factors in that the intrinsic affinity of monomeric OREBP to ORE is low, but the stability of transcription factor-DNA complex is greatly enhanced after complete encirclement of DNA by its dimeric from. Importantly, the lumen formed by the OREBP dimer is sufficient to accommodate only naked DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Stroud1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, a tight control on OREBP transcriptional activity could be achieved by using the nucleosome as a regulatory switch. Nucleosomes could impose steric hindrance to OREBP during the resting state. In contrast, the exposure of ORE via nucleosome(s) eviction and the increase in nuclear abundance of OREBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Tong1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> under hypertonic stress might significantly promote the odds of OREBP-ORE interactions. Although our data suggested that the OREs of AR contained positioned nucleosomes, the number of nucleosomes that were subjected to eviction under hypertonic stress remained unknown. The mapping of nucleosome positions at the OREs locus may help to clarify this issue and would be important to further our understanding of the role of chromatin remodeling in hypertonicity-induced gene expressions.</p><p>How hypertonic stress directs locus-specific histone eviction remains elusive. Hypertonic stress may either mark these histones by a specific or a combination of post-translation modifications that could be recognized by precise remodeling factors. Alternatively, nucleosomes over ORE may be composed of specific histone variants which render them distinctive. Recently it has been shown that histone variant H2A.Z is preferentially incorporated into transcription factor binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Gevry1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. H2A.Z has also been shown to form less stable nucleosomes <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Abbott1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>, undergo eviction in response to DNA damage and promote gene transcription <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Gevry1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore characterizing the identity and the nature of post-translational modifications of these nucleosomes may provide important clues to the molecular mechanisms of the histone eviction process. On the other hand, it will also be important to characterize the role of known ATPase-containing histone remodeling factors, such as Swi/Snf-remodeling complexes that are known to mediate histone displacement <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Bruno1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Phelan1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008435-Lorch1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>, in OREBP-dependent gene transcription. It is becoming apparent that the genome utilizes a combination of DNA sequences and epigenetic modifications to direct active gene transcription or to achieve gene silencing. Our study suggests that chromatin undergoes chromatin remodeling by nucleosome eviction to recruit transcription factors to its target sites for gene activation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank
