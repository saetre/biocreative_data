E2A, the best characterized E-protein family member in mammals, has been shown to have stage specific roles in cell differentiation, lineage commitment, proliferation, and survival. However, due to the complexity of E2A function, it is often difficult to separate these roles using conventional genetic approaches. Here, we have developed a new genetic model for reversible control of E2A protein activity at physiological levels. This system was created by inserting a tamoxifen-responsive region of the estrogen receptor (ER) at the carboxyl end of the <italic>tcfe2a </italic>gene to generate E2AER fusion proteins. We have characterized and analyzed the efficiency and kinetics of this inducible E2A<sup>ER </sup>system in the context of B cell development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>B cell development has been shown previously to be blocked at an early stage in E2A deficient animals. Our E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice demonstrated this predicted block in B cell development, and E2AER DNA binding activity was not detected in the absence of ligand. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies verified rapid induction of E2AER DNA binding activity upon tamoxifen treatment. While tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice showed inefficient rescue of B cell development in live animals, direct exposure of bone marrow cells to tamoxifen in an <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture was sufficient to rescue and support early B cell development from the pre-proB cell stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The E2A<sup>ER </sup>system provides inducible and reversible regulation of E2A function at the protein level. Many previous studies have utilized over-expression systems to induce E2A function, which are complicated by the toxicity often resulting from high levels of E2A. The E2A<sup>ER </sup>model instead restores E2A activity at an endogenous level and in addition, allows for tight regulation of the timing of induction. These features make our E2A<sup>ER </sup><italic>ex vivo </italic>culture system attractive to study both immediate and gradual downstream E2A-mediated events.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>E2A, encoded by the <italic>tcfe2a </italic>gene and a member of the E-protein family, is a basic helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcription factor critical for regulating gene expression in several developmental systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Originally identified as an immunoglobulin (Ig) enhancer binding factor, E2A has since largely been studied for its roles during the development of B and T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. E2A participates in various aspects of lymphocyte development including lineage commitment, initiation of lineage specific gene expression, rearrangement of B and T cell receptor genes, and differentiation through multiple developmental stages. In addition to roles in lineage commitment and cell differentiation, E2A has also been shown to regulate cell cycle, proliferation, and survival.</p><p>E-proteins, including E2A, HEB, and E2-2 in mammals, function as dimers to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. E2A homodimers are the primary E-protein dimers functioning in B cells, whereas E2A-HEB heterodimers are the primary dimers functioning in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent data suggests that E2-2 homodimers are critical for plasmacytoid dendritic cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. E2A also serves as an important dimerization partner for tissue specific HLH transcription factors outside of the lymphoid system. For example, E2A forms dimers with NeuroD and MyoD, key regulators of neuronal and skeletal muscle development, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since E2A is the common factor for multiple lineage specific HLH transcription factor dimers, novel tools for targeting and manipulating E2A function can benefit a range of developmental biology research areas.</p><p>Here we have developed a new genetic model to examine E2A function. We have established an inducible E2A mouse model by inserting a tamoxifen-responsive region of the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain at the carboxyl end of <italic>tcfe2a</italic>, resulting in the production of E2AER fusion proteins. The use of tamoxifen inducible ER fusion proteins in mouse genetics has already been established as a valuable tool, especially with the vast use of the Cre recombinase-ER fusion protein for inducible gene knockout in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, ER fusion with a variety of transcription factors has also been successfully employed for analysis of gene expression. For example, MyoD-ER fusion proteins have been expressed by viral transduction in mouse embryonic fibroblasts for <italic>in vitro </italic>study of MyoD gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in mouse fibroblasts for analysis of MyoD activation <italic>in vivo </italic>post transplantation of transduced cells into recipient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, we do not know how useful the ER system will be in live animals when targeting an endogenous locus. Our E2A<sup>ER </sup>system now introduces an ER fusion with a bHLH transcription factor into the mouse genome for analysis of an endogenously expressed protein.</p><p>E2A<sup>ER/+ </sup>and E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice, along with E2AER protein function, are analyzed here in the context of B cell development. A block in B cell development at the pre-proB cell stage, prior to B lineage commitment, has been characterized by previous E2A-deficient mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A rescue in B cell development from E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells upon tamoxifen treatment would be a stringent test to verify inducible E2AER function.</p><p>In this study, we provide the initial characterization of the E2A<sup>ER </sup>system. E2AER protein activity was rapidly induced upon tamoxifen treatment and reversibly regulated by tamoxifen withdrawal. Even though we show effective induction of E2AER DNA binding activity, tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice did not efficiently restore B cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, tamoxifen treatment was able to rescue and support early B cell development from E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells in an <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture system. Use of E2A<sup>ER </sup><italic>ex vivo </italic>culture systems may therefore be beneficial for the study of gene regulation in B cells and other E2A-regulated cell lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele</title><p>E2A<sup>ER/+ </sup>and E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice were generated by using a knock-in strategy for tamoxifen-inducible E2A function. The tamoxifen-responsive ligand binding domain of the mouse ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] was inserted at the carboxyl end of <italic>tcfe2a </italic>to produce the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). With this targeting strategy, similar to that used for the E2A<sup>GFP </sup>strain previously developed in our lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], both alternatively spliced products of the <italic>tcfe2a </italic>gene, E12 and E47, are translated as ER fusion proteins. Initial characterization of the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele indicated normal expression levels of E2A mRNA in the presence of the ER insertion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Previous study of E2A knockout mice has demonstrated stunted growth and a high lethality rate of homozygous animals within the first few weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In contrast, the E2A<sup>E47bm </sup>strain, expressing a dominant negative form of E47, was originally described as indistinguishable from wild-type litter mates in size and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, this work was analyzing mice on a mixed genetic background. Upon backcrossing to C57BL/6, the E2A<sup>E47bm/E47bm </sup>mice became smaller in size and demonstrated the high lethality rate like that shown with the knockout animals (unpublished data). E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>animals also exhibit stunted growth and reduced survival (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Fortunately, the lethality rate in our experience has been less severe in litters from the E2A<sup>ER </sup>strain than that observed with our E2A knockout and dominant negative strains. However, we do not know if this slight increase in postnatal survival is due to the presence of the E2AER protein or because our E2A<sup>ER </sup>strain is currently on a mixed background.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele</bold>.

The pre-proB cell stage is an intermediate stage as lymphoid progenitors develop into committed proB cells. Pre-proB cells can be characterized by the expression of B220 and CD43 and the absence of CD19 expression. As pre-proB cells transition to the proB cell stage, CD19 expression is induced and cells undergo commitment to the B cell lineage. E2A is critical for this transition, as demonstrated by the block in development at the pre-proB cell stage in E2A-deficient animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Analysis of E2A<sup>GFP </sup>mice displays the up-regulation of E2A protein levels from the pre-proB to proB stage (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This increase in E2A expression is likely critical for E2A's regulation of the B cell lineage gene expression profile given the importance of E2A gene dosage. For example, elimination of one copy of E2A has been shown to greatly reduce the number of proB cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Investigation of B cell development in E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice revealed a block at the pre-proB cell stage, similar to that seen in the E2A-mutant E2A<sup>E47bm/E47bm </sup>mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Occasionally we have observed a small population of CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the bone marrow of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice, but these incidences of leaky B cell development did not appear to produce a significant population of mature, Ig expressing B cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

E2AER protein expression was verified by Western Blot analysis of whole cell lysates from E2A<sup>ER/+ </sup>and E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>Abelson cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). While E2AER protein levels appeared similar to wild-type levels when comparing E2A<sup>+/+ </sup>and E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>cells, analysis of E2A<sup>ER/+ </sup>cells suggested that E2AER protein expression may be lower than wild-type. Protein analysis of tamoxifen treated cells displayed similar results, indicating that the relative E2AER protein levels are not affected by the presence or absence of tamoxifen. Nuclear extracts from E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>Abelson cells were then used to conduct electrophoretic gel shift analysis of E2AER binding to an E2A binding sequence, &#x003bc;E5. In the absence of tamoxifen treatment, no DNA binding activity was observed from the E2AER protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Together, the block in B cell development and lack of E2AER DNA binding activity suggest that the E2A<sup>ER </sup>mouse model functions as an E2A-deficient system in the absence of ligand.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Induction and reversible regulation of E2AER DNA binding activity</bold>.

In addition to using CD19 expression to validate the rescue of B cell development, we analyzed Pax5 expression throughout the 5 day culture. Pax5, initiated downstream of E2A expression, is a transcription factor critical for B cell lineage commitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

We next used this culture system to determine if induction of E2AER activity could also support IgH V to DJ recombination. To amplify V to DJ rearrangements, we chose primers recognizing members of the V<sub>H</sub>1 gene family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which represent a large percentage of the total IgH V genes, and primers recognizing the J<sub>H</sub>4 gene segment. Rearrangements were analyzed in Day 8 cultured samples because we did not observe consistent V to DJ PCR signals until this point in the time course analysis. Wild-type mice were used as positive controls for detecting recombination events, and mice deficient in the recombination activating gene RAG1, required for V(D)J recombination, were used as negative controls. Analysis of Day 8 cultures demonstrated a clear V to DJ rearrangement product from tamoxifen treated E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). V to DJ rearrangement was further verified by sequencing analysis (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

However, only one unique rearrangement product was identified out of all of the colonies sequenced for this sample. In addition to providing functional proof of induced E2A activity, the detection of IgH recombination, along with the induction of CD19 and Pax5 expression described above, suggests that restored E2A function can rescue B cell development from the pre-proB cell stage.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>IgH recombination detected upon culture of tamoxifen treated E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells</bold>.

Previous analysis using over-expression of E2AER fusion proteins by retroviral transduction has already demonstrated the value of inducible E2A activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, toxicity is often a problem with high levels of E2A in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], and viral transduction is not ideal for all cell types. In addition, the changes in gene expression detected upon over-expression of E2A may not always be representative of endogenous E2A function. Therefore, generation of the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele provides an attractive system for studying gene regulation and other E2A-regulated events in potentially any E2A-expressing cell type at a more physiological level.</p><p>Here we demonstrate the rapid induction of E2AER DNA binding activity upon tamoxifen treatment and its potential for reversible function upon tamoxifen withdrawal. The ability to tightly control E2A activity allows for kinetic analysis of downstream events. Analysis of B cell development in our <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture system demonstrated a rescue from the pre-proB cell stage, but suggested delayed kinetics from E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells compared to B cell development from control pre-proB cells. This result suggests that even though E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>and wild-type pre-proB cells are phenotypically similar, E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells may not have equivalent developmental potential or may require additional cellular changes prior to entering the B cell lineage. It is possible that E2A-regulated events normally occurring earlier in development, as suggested in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP), and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], were occurring upon restored E2A function in pre-proB cells and requiring these cells to "catch up" with their wild-type counterparts prior to progressing to the next stage. Alternatively, the developing tamoxifen-treated E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>B cells may not have expanded as rapidly as wild-type cells upon commitment to the B cell lineage. Our Western Blot analysis of E2A proteins in E2A<sup>ER/+ </sup>Abelson cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) suggested that the E2AER protein level may also have been contributing to the delayed kinetics. In this sample, the E2AER band appeared less intense than the wild-type E2A band. However, it is not possible to determine from this analysis if the lower intensity was a result of reduced protein levels or variation in antibody affinity for the E2AER versus wild-type E2A protein. In addition, there was not a striking difference between the E2AER and wild-type protein levels when comparing the E2A<sup>+/+ </sup>and E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>samples. Further investigation of tamoxifen treated E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>pre-proB cells will be necessary to understand why the delayed detection of CD19<sup>+ </sup>B cells was observed.</p><p>Our <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture data clearly indicated a rescue of early B cell development to the proB cell stage. However, we have so far been unable to determine if tamoxifen treatment can rescue E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>B cells through the subsequent preB cell stage, when E2A is known to be critical for Ig kappa light chain (Igk) recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We were unable to test for induction of Igk recombination or surface IgM expression by using our <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture system because this system primarily supports development at a stage prior to these events (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref> and data not shown). The presence of the small, but increased, population of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>IgM<sup>+ </sup>B cells in the <italic>in vivo </italic>treatment experiment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) is the only current evidence suggesting tamoxifen-induced E2AER activity may be able to rescue B cell development to maturity. Additional B cell culture systems would be necessary to determine if tamoxifen treatment can rescue later stages of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>B cell development.</p><p>While <italic>in vivo </italic>tamoxifen treatment was not efficient for restoring B cell development, <italic>in vivo </italic>treatment may still be useful for analysis of E2A function in other cell lineages. We suggest two reasons for ineffective rescue of <italic>in vivo </italic>B cell development. First, progression through several stages of lymphocyte development is known to be dependent on proper E-protein dosage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and it is possible that the required E2A threshold is not maintained during our <italic>in vivo </italic>treatment for rescue of B cell development. For example, as mentioned above, we do not know if E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>cells can sufficiently progress through the preB cell stage of development. Second, E2A has been suggested to be important for B cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that even if B cells are rescued by tamoxifen treatment, they may be lost if E2AER activity is not maintained throughout the treatment.</p><p>The E2A<sup>ER </sup>system may instead be more valuable for <italic>in vivo </italic>study of T cell development, or other lineages expressing multiple E-protein family members. Since E-proteins demonstrate many redundant functions, T cell development is not completely blocked in E2A-deficient mice due to the presence of HEB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Because T cells are fully developed in E2A-deficient mice, <italic>in vivo </italic>tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice may be more valuable for the study of E2A function during T cell development.</p><p>There are many additional applications for the E2A<sup>ER </sup>system. In addition to advantages in speed, expression level, and reversibility, this inducible system may allow analysis of E2A function in specific cell stages that have been difficult to analyze in previous E2A-deficient models. Tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>cells may be valuable by allowing progression to developmental stages that are absent in E2A-deficient animals or affected due to the lack of E2A at earlier developmental stages. E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice also provide a useful tool for studying changes in E2A function with age or for analyzing E-protein function in combination with other genetic models. Given the rapid induction of E2AER DNA binding activity upon <italic>in vitro </italic>tamoxifen treatment, we believe that the use of E2A<sup>ER </sup><italic>ex vivo </italic>culture systems may be most valuable, especially for identifying new E2A targets and studying the kinetics of E2A gene regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have established a new genetic model by generating the E2A<sup>ER </sup>allele. This model allows for inducible function of E2A, a transcription factor displaying an extensive range of functions across multiple developmental programs. E2AER activity is rapidly induced at the protein level upon tamoxifen treatment and is reversible upon tamoxifen withdrawal. Tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER </sup>mice was, however, unable to efficiently restore wild-type levels of B cells. The functionality of E2AER was instead successfully verified by <italic>ex vivo </italic>tamoxifen treatment of E2A<sup>ER/ER</sup> B cell progenitors. In this <italic>ex vivo </italic>culture system, induced E2AER protein function was able to rescue and support early B cell development. Thus, the E2A<sup>ER </sup>model provides an attractive system to regulate and study E2A protein function, especially under <italic>ex vivo </italic>conditions where cells can gain sustained access to high levels of tamoxifen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>E2A<sup>E47bm </sup>mice have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
