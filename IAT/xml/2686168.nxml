To search for genes that show methylation change during adipogenesis, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells was performed using a method called microarray-based integrated analysis of methylation by isoschizomers (MIAMI). The MIAMI revealed that <italic>Hpa</italic> II sites of exon 1 in a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 19 (ARHGEF19; WGEF) gene were demethylated during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Deletion of the region containing cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites that showed methylation change suppressed transcriptional activity in the reporter assay, indicating that this region regulates WGEF transcription. WGEF expression in 3T3-L1 cells was reduced during adipocyte differentiation, and high-fat diet-induced obese mice also showed lower expression of WGEF gene than control mice in white adipose tissue. Additionally, forced expression of WGEF in 3T3-L1 cells down-regulated the expression of adipogenic marker genes and inhibited the adipogenic program. This study clarified that adipogenesis was regulated by WGEF expression through DNA methylation change.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>5-methylcytosine is the only covalent DNA modification known in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Jeltsch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accumulation of adipocytes usually results in obesity, and genes that regulate adipogenesis could be regulated by epigenetic DNA modifications; thus, it is very important to search for adipogenic genes that are regulatd by DNA methylation.</p><p>Previously, we developed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis called MIAMI using a microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Hatada1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. With this method, we detected DNA methylation using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme <italic>Hpa</italic> II and its methylation-insensitive isoschizomer <italic>Msp</italic> I. <italic>Hpa</italic> II cleavage differences are usually related to methylation differences of two samples.

In this study, the MIAMI method was applied to genome-wide DNA methylation analysis for insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells, and we found a dramatic methylation change of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 19 (ARHGEF19; WGEF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> during adipocyte differentiation.</p><p>WGEF is one of the members of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). RhoGEFs stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP to generate the activated form of GTPases, which is then capable of recognizing downstream targets, or effector proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Schmidt1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The Rho family of small GTPases, activated by RhoGEFs, has been shown to regulate a variety of cytoskeletal-dependent cell functions, such as cell morphology changes, formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers, platelet aggregation, cytokinesis, cell-cycle progression, and neurite outgrowth and guidance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-EtienneManneville1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, Rho family proteins are also involved in the differentiation of many cell types, including neurons, T lymphocytes, myocytes and keratinocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Bryan1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Govek1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, RhoGEFs have important roles in many physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms via the activation of Rho GTPases. On the other hand, WGEF is expressed mainly in the intestine, liver, heart, and kidney, and it can mainly activate RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. According to another research, RhoA inhibits adipogenesis by the regulation of cytoskeletal tension through the RhoA-Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-McBeath1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These two reports are associated with the existence of adipogenic regulation through the WGEF-RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway; however, no direct evidences have been demonstrated.</p><p>Here, we show that epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation in the WGEF gene, plays an important role in transcriptional activity, and we also prove that WGEF regulates adipocyte differentiation through the WGEF-RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>3T3-L1 cells were grown and maintained in DMEM containing 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum (Gibco).

The probes are located on Hpa II fragments of less than 600 base pairs and cover 10,263 genes. Hpa II cleavage differences are related to methylation differences of two samples before and after differentiation. We found that 6430573B13Rik (WGEF) and 4931406C07Rik genes clearly showed demethylation after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).

RhoGEF families, including WGEF, have important roles in many physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms via the activation of Rho GTPases; therefore, we performed more detailed analyses of the WGEF gene.

In order to determine if WGEF can regulate the process of adipogenesis, we made six WGEF-transfected stable cell lines (W1&#x02013;W6) and five vector control (GFP-transfected) stable cell lines (G1&#x02013;G5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

As a visual measure of the effect of WGEF on adipogenesis, we carried out Oil Red O (ORO) staining to detect lipid granules in 3T3-L1 cells. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells produce lipid granules that can be stained with ORO. We found that vector control cells exhibited clearly more stained lipid droplets than WGEF-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). According to real-time RT-PCR analysis, excessive expression of WGEF inhibited adipogenesis, whereas over 50&#x00025; reduction in WGEF expression could not inhibit (i.e. W5 cell line). Further, in the same stable cell line, cells with a high expression of WGEF were not differentiated, whereas those with a low expression produced lipid granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>).

We profiled global DNA methylation during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells using a microarray-based method called MIAMI, and found dramatic methylation change in the WGEF gene. Detailed analyses clarified that methylation changes of WGEF were completed prior to complete repression of the expression during adipocyte differentiation. This finding indicates the possibility that methylation change in exon 1 and the upstream region regulates transcriptional activity of the WGEF gene. The results of luciferase reporter assays show evidence that the region containing &#x02212;81 (E-box-like site) and &#x0002b;120 (<italic>Hpa</italic> II site2) positions regulates WGEF transcription.</p><p>Generally, chromatin modification by CpG methylation has been linked with transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Cameron1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, transcription of WGEF has been upregulated by CpG methylation. At first glance, the relationship between methylation and transcription in WGEF seems to be contradictory; however, there are some reports that methylation in the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; region activates gene expression. In human osteoblast-like MG63 cells, for example, methylation in the distal promoter part of the PDPN gene promotes PDPN transcription efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Hantusch1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. They hypothesized that methylation-dependent protein-DNA interactions stimulate transcription. The zinc finger protein Kaiso has also been found to bind specifically to methylated sites in a sequence-specific manner, activating functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Rodova1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the existence of methylation-dependent proteins that promote transcription was reported by some researchers. In the case of WGEF, methylation-dependent binding proteins able to promote transcription may bind to the upstream region of the WGEF gene. In fact, deletion of the region containing E-box-like site and <italic>Hpa</italic> II site2 suppressed transcriptional activity in the reporter assay, indicating that this region regulates WGEF transcription at least.</p><p>In expression analysis, our data demonstrate a strong down-regulation of WGEF expression during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, suggesting that this gene may be essential for maintaining the undifferentiated status of these cells. High-fat diet-induced obese mice showed lower expression of WGEF than control mice in white adipose tissue, supporting this idea. According to expectations, an excessive or equivalent level forced the expression of WGEF compared to undifferentiated cells that inhibited adipocyte differentiation; however, more than 50&#x00025; reduction of expression level led to differentiation. Additionally, using real-time RT-PCR analysis measuring adipogenic markers PPAR-&#x003b3;, Adipsin and Gapdh, we observed a strong inhibition of marker gene expression in WGEF-transfected cells compared to vector control transfected cells. Thus, we have obtained the first evidence that WGEF signaling pathways act as potential regulators of adipogenesis.</p><p>WGEF can activate Rho family G-proteins such as RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Wang1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Another study shows that RhoA inhibits adipogenesis by activation of the RhoA effector, ROCK which regulates cytoskeletal tension by actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-McBeath1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These two studies indirectly suggest the inhibition of adipogenesis by WGEF-RhoA-ROCK signaling. In our study, WGEF-transfected cells did not start adipogenesis, whereas they started adipogenesis after treatment with RhoA-ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632. This result directly shows that the inhibition of adipogenesis is caused by WGEF-RhoA-ROCK signaling. As noted above, RhoGEFs, including WGEF, activate Rho GTPases. In contrast, RhoGAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis, which results in the inactivation of Rho GTPases. Interestingly, mice lacking p190-B RhoGAP show a dramatic reduction of mature adipocytes because excessive Rho activity in the absence of RhoGAPs inhibits adipogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Sordella1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In other words, their report suggests that excessive RhoGEF expression inhibits adipogenesis. Furthermore, it has been reported that another member of RhoGEFs, GEFT, also inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells via the activation of RhoA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005809-Bryan2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. According to their report, cotransfection of GEFT with the PPAR-&#x003b3; luciferase construct resulted in a reduction from baseline luciferase activity. Our results also indicated the strong inhibition of PPAR-&#x003b3; transcription by the forced expression of WGEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). WGEF transfected cells that were treated with the ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 certainly started adipogenesis; however, the differentiation level of these cells did not reach that of normal control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005809-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). This suggests that WGEF blocks the adipogenic program via not only the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway but also via other pathways, such as the PPAR-&#x003b3;-mediated signaling pathway which is one of the most critical programs of adipogenesis. In any case, it is clear that WGEF plays a very important role in adipogenesis through the WGEF-RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway by epigenetic regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Waka
