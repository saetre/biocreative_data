How these programmes are coordinated, however, is largely unknown. We found that the transcription of miR379&#x02013;410, a large cluster of brain-specific microRNAs (miRNAs), is induced by increasing neuronal activity in primary rat neurons. Results from chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays suggest that binding of the transcription factor myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2) upstream of miR379&#x02013;410 is necessary and sufficient for activity-dependent transcription of the cluster. Mef2-induced expression of at least three individual miRNAs of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is required for activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. One of these miRNAs, the dendritic miR-134, promotes outgrowth by inhibiting translation of the mRNA encoding for the translational repressor Pumilio2. In summary, we have described a novel regulatory pathway that couples activity-dependent transcription to miRNA-dependent translational control of gene expression during neuronal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dendritogenesis</kwd><kwd>Mef2</kwd><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>neuronal activity</kwd><kwd>Pumilio</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development and refinement of neuronal circuitry are regulated by both intrinsic and activity-dependent programmes of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). The latter is particularly important at later stages of neuronal development, such as dendritogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Chen and Ghosh, 2005</xref>) and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Waites <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). An important layer of regulation is new transcription induced by activity-regulated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hong <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). For example, CREB has a key function in activity-dependent dendritic outgrowth of central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Lonze and Ginty, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Redmond <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, the activity-dependent transcription factor, myocyte enhancing factor 2 (Mef2), functions as a negative regulator of excitatory synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Flavell <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Shalizi <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Morphological abnormalities in dendritic arbourization and postsynaptic structure are common hallmarks of a number of cognitive diseases, for example, mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bagni and Greenough, 2005</xref>). Activity-dependent regulation of gene expression involves, in addition to the activation of new transcriptional programmes within the nucleus, also post-transcriptional control of pre-existing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Steward, 2002</xref>). The expression of pre-existing mRNAs is often regulated locally in dendrites close to synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). Important post-transcriptional regulatory molecules are RNA-binding proteins (i.e. CPEB, Pumilio (Pum), etc.) that regulate transport, stability or translation of the mRNAs in response to activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kiebler and Bassell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Richter, 2007</xref>). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are another class of key post-transcriptional regulators that can bind to the 3&#x02032;UTR of target mRNAs to downregulate their expression by inducing either mRNA degradation or translational suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kosik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Fiore <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Little is known, however, on how these two mechanisms of activity-dependent gene expression, global transcriptional control and local post-transcriptional control, are coordinated within a neuron.</p><p>We have previously shown that miR-134 controls spine morphogenesis in rat hippocampal neuron by repressing local translation of the LimK1 mRNA within dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Schratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). BDNF, which is secreted in response to neuronal activity, relieves the translational block of the LimK1 mRNA thereby allowing spine growth. It is still an open question whether miR-134 function is also controlled globally within a neuron at the transcriptional level. Intriguingly, the miR-134 gene is clustered together with more than 50 other miRNAs within the <italic>Gtl2/Dlk1</italic> locus (referred hereafter as the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Seitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Clustered miRNA genes are often co-expressed, a prerequisite for the coordinated control of related biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">He <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). In this study, we provide evidence that the entire miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is co-regulated at the transcriptional level by neuronal activity in a Mef2-dependent manner. Importantly, activity-dependent regulation of multiple miRNAs from the cluster, including miR-134, is necessary for the correct elaboration of the dendritic tree. Furthermore, we show that the RNA-binding protein Pum2 is a direct miR-134 target and a key mediator of the miR-134 growth-promoting effect on dendritogenesis. Our results point to the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster, in particular miR-134, as a key component of a mechanism that couples transcriptional and local control of gene expression in response to neuronal activity during the development of neural circuitry.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>The miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is co-regulated by neuronal activity</title><p>Recently, we provided evidence that miR-134 regulates activity-dependent control of dendritic mRNA translation in response to BDNF. We decided to investigate whether neuronal activity also regulates miR-134 and possibly the entire miR379&#x02013;410 cluster globally within the cell at the transcriptional level.</p><p>We first tested whether expression of candidate miRNAs of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster was coordinately induced by neuronal activity. We used either membrane-depolarizing concentrations of KCl, which leads to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> influx, or the application of BDNF, a growth factor released by synaptic stimulation, as paradigms to mimic neuronal activity in a culture of dissociated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Redmond <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wayman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Primary cortical neurons cultured for 5 days <italic>in vitro</italic> (5DIV) were treated with either BDNF or KCl for up to 6 h. After isolation of total RNA, the expression of pre-miRNAs that are encoded at different positions within the <italic>GTl2/DLK1</italic> locus was analysed by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with our earlier findings, miRNAs from the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster (including miR-134) are expressed at very low levels in unstimulated neurons at this early developmental stage. Strikingly, all of the tested pre-miRNAs located within miR379&#x02013;410 were robustly induced by both BDNF and KCl stimulation. Similar to the known activity-regulated cFos gene, miR379&#x02013;410 pre-miRNA induction was both rapid and transient, peaking at 2 h and lasting for at least 6 h. The level of the neighbouring Gtl2 transcript was not affected by KCl and BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A&#x02013;C</xref>), demonstrating that our treatment led to a specific induction of the miR379&#x02013;410 domain.</p><p>We next investigated the effect of membrane depolarization on the levels and subcellular localization of one of the miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs, miR-134, by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) of primary hippocampal neurons (DIV7). We used a probe that was able to recognize both mature and pre-miR-134. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). Low levels of miR-134 were detectable in unstimulated neurons and KCl led to a robust and specific increase in miR-134 ISH signal, confirming our results obtained with quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The KCl-mediated increase was completely abolished by pretreatment of neurons with actinomycin D, demonstrating that the increase was due to <italic>de novo</italic> miR-134 transcription (data not shown). The increase of miR-134 upon depolarization was not restricted to the soma but the miR-134 signal was also evident in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>, higher magnification panels). Quantification of the <italic>in situ</italic> signal confirmed the depolarization-induced increase of miR-134 in both the somatic and dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>). The robust increase of miR-134 in dendrites suggests a local function in this compartment. So far, our expression analysis did not directly address whether our activity paradigm induces functional miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs. To verify that neuronal activation induces the expression of mature and functional miRNAs from the cluster, we used a previously described single cell sensor assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Mansfield <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). We used bicistronic GFP/dsRED expression vectors (&#x02018;sensor'), the expression of which is controlled by miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs due to two perfectly complementary miRNA-binding sites in the 3&#x02032;UTR of the dsRED gene. Neurons that express functional miRNA (miRNA positive) are identified by the lack of dsRED due to RISC-mediated cleavage of the dsRED mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). The number of miRNA-positive neurons increased upon depolarization for all tested miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>), validating that neuronal activity induces functional miRNAs. Co-transfection of the sensors with specific 2'<italic>O</italic>-methyl antisense oligonucleotides (anti-miRs) confirmed that the increase in miRNA-positive cells was due to a specific elevation of miRNA activity. These results also demonstrate that anti-miRs can be used to specifically interfere with the function of the KCl-induced miRNAs miR-329, -134 and -541.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mef2 is necessary for activity-dependent regulation of the miRNA-379&#x02013;410 cluster</title><p>We devised a comparative genomic approach based on sequence conservation to identify regulatory elements that could mediate activity-dependent transcription of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. Highly conserved regions within 20 kb upstream of the cluster were screened for potential binding sites for activity-regulated transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thereby, we identified 10 potential binding sites for Mef2, a known activity-regulated transcription factor that negatively regulates synapse number in mature hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Shalizi and Bonni, 2005</xref>). The occupancy of the putative Mef2-binding sites (MBSs) <italic>in vivo</italic> was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using DIV5 primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref> and data not shown). A PCR product encompassing one of the potential MBS, MBS10, could be specifically amplified from immunoprecipitates of formaldehyde-fixed chromatin using a Mef2-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel), in a similar manner as the known Mef2 target gene Nur77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper and lower panels). In contrast, Mef2 antibodies were unable to enrich chromatin from the &#x003b2;-globin locus that lacks a MBS, confirming the specificity of our ChIP protocol. Therefore, Mef2 is bound to MBS10 in neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>. To begin to assess the relevance of MBS10 in activity-dependent transcription of miR379&#x02013;410, we first monitored the presence of a transcript between the miR-379 gene and MBS10. Using RT&#x02013;PCR with a set of overlapping primers located within the region from MBS10 to miR-379, we were able to detect a continuous transcript except for a small gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, primer pairs 6 and 7, and data not shown). This gap consists of highly repetitive sequence that is likely resistant to PCR amplification. In further support of the existence of a long, continuous transcript spanning the region from MBS10 all the way to the end of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster, we found that the detected PCR fragments, similar to the adjacent miRNA genes, were robustly induced by depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, our transcript analysis supports the idea that the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is transcribed as a single polycistronic unit starting in the proximity of MBS10.</p><p>To test the functionality of MBS10, we cloned either the wild-type or a mutated MBS10 upstream of a minimal promoter driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-MBS10). The expression of a constitutively active mutant of Mef2 (Mef2-VP16) in cortical neurons induced luciferase activity from MBS10 reporter construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>) to a similar extent as a promoter construct derived from a known Mef2 target gene (pGL3-Nur77). The DNA-binding deficient mutant Mef2&#x00394;DBD-VP16 failed to increase the activity of both the Nur77 and MBS10 luciferase reporters, suggesting that induction is dependent upon Mef2 binding. This is further supported by the lack of induction of the pGL3-MBS10mut upon co-transfection with Mef2-VP16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). We next investigated the role of endogenous Mef2 in activity-dependent transcriptional control of the cluster. KCl or BDNF stimulation induced expression of pGL3-MBS10, with a more prominent effect observed in membrane-depolarized neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Importantly, both KCl and BDNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B and C</xref>)-mediated induction were strongly attenuated upon Mef2 knockdown using a previously published Mef2 shRNA construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Flavell <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Simultaneous introduction of an RNAi-resistant Mef2 expression vector (RiRMef2) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of Mef2 knockdown, demonstrating the specificity of the siRNAs. Taken together, results from reporter assays suggest that endogenous Mef2 is required for the depolarization-induced regulation of the miRNA cluster. To confirm that activity-regulated transcription of the endogenous miRNAs is Mef2 dependent, we infected primary neurons using a lentivirus expressing the described Mef2 siRNA. Infected cultures were stimulated with KCl and the levels of selected endogenous miR379&#x02013;410 pre-miRNAs were assessed by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. For all the miRNAs from the cluster analysed (miR-134 -154, and -376b), Mef2 knockdown significantly reduced the magnitude of KCl-mediated induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). This effect was specific, as Mef2 knockdown did not affect activity-dependent induction of CREM, a gene that is not regulated by Mef2. Taken together, our data indicate that Mef2 activates miRNA expression in response to neuronal activity by binding to a site located 20 kb upstream of the miRNA cluster.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activity-dependent expression of miR379&#x02013;410 cluster miRNAs is necessary for dendritic development</title><p>A large number of studies have provided evidence that activity-dependent transcription during early stages of synaptic development has a critical function in dendritic outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Whitford <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). To address the physiological relevance of activity-dependent transcription of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster, we therefore tested whether perturbation of miR379&#x02013;410 members affected the ability of neurons to elaborate the dendritic tree in response to activity. To mimic activity-dependent dendritogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic>, cultured hippocampal neurons (DIV7) were treated for 6 h with KCl or BDNF and analysed by Sholl analysis (see Materials and methods) at DIV10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Wayman <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Both membrane depolarization and BDNF treatment increased the complexity of the dendritic arbour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel) as indicated by a higher number of branches and an increase in the total dendritic length. To obtain a quantitative estimate of activity-dependent changes in complexity, we calculated an induction index by dividing the total number of intersections derived from the Sholl analysis of stimulated neurons to that of unstimulated neurons. Treating neurons with a specific miR-134 anti-miR completely abolished the KCl- and BDNF-mediated increase in dendritic complexity, but had no significant effect on dendrites under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). An antisense oligonucleotide of unrelated sequence (anti-miR control) had no effect on dendritic complexity under both basal and stimulated conditions, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-miR-134. Furthermore, an miR-134 antisense inhibitor of a different chemistry (LNA-modified nucleotides) had a similar effect on the induction index after both KCl and BDNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). We next extended our analysis to other miRNAs from the cluster. Of the four miRNAs considered, we found that anti-miR inhibition of two of them (miR-381 and -329), also blocked activity-dependent dendritogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of two other cluster members (miR-495 and -541) had no effect on dendritic complexity under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>). The lack of a dendritic phenotype is unlikely due to inefficient inhibition of these miRNAs, as anti-miRs effectively interfered with three different miRNAs in our sensors assays including miR-541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, activity-dependent expression of multiple, but not all miRNAs from the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is required for activity-dependent dendritic growth. The requirement of activity-induced expression of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is further supported by our observation that knock down of its upstream activator Mef2 phenocopies miRNA loss of function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4E</xref>). The negative effect of Mef2 siRNA on KCl-dependent dendritogenesis can be rescued by co-transfection of RiRMef2. These data show a previously unknown function of Mef2 in activity-dependent dendritogenesis and identify miRNAs from the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster as one of the key mediators of this new role of Mef2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pum2 is an miR-134 target</title><p>To gain insight into the mechanism by which members of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster regulate dendritogenesis, we searched for target mRNAs using the Target Scan prediction algorithm. Initially, we focused on predictions that contained multiple sites for individual members of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. Intriguingly, we found that the RNA-binding protein Pum2, a protein that has been recently implicated in the control of dendrite morphogenesis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Ye <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), contains in its 3&#x02032;UTR multiple potential binding sites for functionally important miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5A</xref>). Two Pum2 3&#x02032;UTR of different lengths have been predicted. The shorter one has been experimentally isolated and includes putative binding site for miR-134 and miR-376b. The longer 3&#x02032;UTR includes, in addition, sites for miR-381 and miR-329. To test whether the predicted miRNA-binding sites are functional, we cloned both Pum2 3&#x02032;UTRs downstream of the coding region of a firefly luciferase reporter gene, and monitored luciferase activity in the presence of specific anti-miRs in rat cortical neurons. Under conditions of high neuronal activity, inhibition of miR-134 led to a robust increase in relative luciferase activity of the constructs containing the wild-type Pum2 3&#x02032;UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Importantly anti-miR-134 did not affect luciferase activity of the reporter under basal condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>), suggesting that after depolarization, newly transcribed miR-134 binds to and downregulates the expression of the Pum2 mRNA. A number of anti-miRs of different sequence, including three directed against members of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster (anti-miR-376b, -381 and -329) had no effect demonstrating the specificity of anti-miR-134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> and data not shown). Importantly, miR-134 is the most conserved of the five putative binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>) we tested, and is present in both predicted isoforms of the Pum2 3&#x02032;UTR. Both observations suggest a functionally significant role of the miR-134 site in the regulation of Pum2 translation. To verify that inhibition of reporter gene activity was dependent on a functional miR-134-binding site in the 3&#x02032;UTR, we cloned a luciferase reporter where the critical seed region in the miR-134 responsive element was mutated. Comparison of the mutated and wild-type Pum2 luciferase reporter activity in cortical neurons after KCl stimulation showed that, first, the mutant reporter is not downregulated after depolarization and, second, co-transfection of pGL3-Pum2mut with anti-miR-134 does not result in an increase in the activity of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results indicate that binding of miR-134 to the 3&#x02032;UTR of Pum2 is critical for the repression of the reporter after KCl stimulation. Induction of other miRNAs from the cluster appears to be less relevant for the regulation of Pum2 mRNA translation, at least under our experimental conditions.</p><p>We next investigated whether miR-134 is able to downregulate the endogenous Pum2 protein. First, overexpression of miR-134 duplex RNA in hippocampal neurons resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous Pum2 protein levels as assessed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). As a control, overexpression of an unrelated miRNA (Let-7) did not affect Pum2 levels in transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p>Second, transduction of rat hippocampal neurons with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) overexpressing miR-134 led to a significant decrease in Pum2 protein levels compared with control conditions as assessed by western blotting. &#x003b2;-Actin levels remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5F and G</xref>).</p><p>Co-transfection of the Pum2 luciferase reporter together with either Si-Mef2 or Mef2-VP16 confirmed that Mef2 contributes to KCl-mediated inhibition of the reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4A</xref>) and that activated Mef2 on its own is sufficient to induce a significant decrease in Pum2 reporter gene activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4B</xref>). In summary, our results indicate that miR-134 is a negative regulator of Pum2 protein expression following membrane depolarization. They further suggest that Mef2 is an important component of this pathway, presumably through induction of miR-134.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Downregulation of Pum2 by miR-134 is necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum homologue is essential for dendrite morphogenesis in peripheral neurons, suggesting that the Pum2&#x02013;miR-134 interaction might also be involved in this process in mammals. We used RNA interference to probe the function of Pum2 in miR-134-regulated activity-dependent dendritogenesis. Two siRNAs (Si-Pum2-1 and Si-Pum2-2) directed against the rat Pum2 mRNA were able to efficiently downregulate the expression of recombinant Pum2 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). Immunocytochemistry revealed a significant and specific decrease in the endogenous protein in hippocampal neurons upon transfection of one of the active siRNAs, Si-Pum2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). To determine whether Pum2 is a physiologically relevant miR-134 target for activity-dependent dendritogenesis, we asked whether siRNA-mediated reduction of Pum2 levels was able to rescue the reduced dendrite complexity observed upon miR-134 inhibition in membrane-depolarized neurons. To this end, hippocampal neurons were transfected with anti-miR-134 together with either Si-Pum2-2 or a control siRNA (Si control). We found that knock down of Pum2 using two independent siRNAs (Si-Pum2-1 and Si-Pum2-2) specifically rescues the miR-134 loss of function phenotype whereas the Si control had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref> and D; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). Thus, downregulation of Pum2 protein expression by miR-134 is necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis.</p><p>We next investigated whether expression of miR-134 or downregulation of Pum2 is sufficient to trigger dendritic outgrowth. Transfection of hippocampal neurons with either miR-134 duplex or Si-Pum2 did not increase basal dendritic complexity (data not shown). Surprisingly, membrane depolarization also failed to induce dendritic outgrowth in cells overexpressing miR-134 or the Si-Pum2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Thus, both decreasing and increasing Pum2 expression by means of miR-134 perturbation are detrimental to activity-dependent dendritogenesis. Our results are consistent with a role for miR-134 in fine-tuning gene expression during dendritogenesis. Consistent with such a fine-tuning relationship between miR-134 and Pum2, overexpression of Pum2 similarly precludes an activity-dependent increase in dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6F</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that miR-134 buffers Pum2 levels within a narrow range critical for activity-dependent dendritogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neurons respond to changes in their activity status by remodelling the dendritic tree and the number and strength of synapses. This morphological and functional plasticity is necessary for correct neuronal development and modulates numerous behavioural adaptations such as memory formation and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kandel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Calabresi <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). We have previously shown that several miRNAs enriched in the dendritic compartment control local protein synthesis and are necessary for spine morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Schratt <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Siegel <italic>et al</italic>, 2009</xref>). Importantly, the function of one of them, miR-134, is modulated locally by neuronal activity. We now show that activity-dependent regulation of miR-134 is not limited to the dendritic compartment but is controlled globally within the neuron by an activity-dependent transcriptional programme. The miR-134 gene is located within the <italic>Gtl2/Dlk1</italic> locus clustered together with more than 50 other miRNA genes. Membrane depolarization or BDNF treatment enhances the expression of all the miRNAs within the cluster that we tested. We validated these miRNAs as new targets for the activity-regulated transcription factor Mef2, a regulator of synapse number and differentiation, and show that activity-dependent, Mef2-mediated expression of the miRNA cluster is necessary for the development of the dendritic tree in primary neurons. MiR-134 specifically regulates activity-dependent dendritogenesis by a novel pathway, namely the downregulation of the RNA-binding protein and translational repressor Pum2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6H</xref>). Our results, together with existing data, show that miRNA function is regulated at multiple levels by neuronal activity, and suggest that miRNAs are critical components of the relay that coordinates nuclear programmes of gene expression with local changes in dendritic and synaptic morphology in response to neuronal activity.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Activity-dependent regulation of the miR379-410 cluster</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster is co-regulated by neuronal activity and might be transcribed as a single polycistronic unit. First, all the miRNAs located in the distal part of the <italic>GTL2/DLK1</italic> locus show a very similar brain-specific expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Seitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Second, BDNF and KCl treatment lead to a very similar induction profile of pre-miRNAs from the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Third, knock down of Mef2 greatly reduces the stimulation-induced expression of all the miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, we could detect an overlapping transcript by RT&#x02013;PCR spanning about 20 kb upstream of the first miRNA within the cluster. Northern blot analysis will be necessary to confirm the existence of a large continuous transcript spanning the entire miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. We identified a Mef2-binding element (MBS10) about 20 kb upstream of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. Our results show that MBS10 is occupied by Mef2 <italic>in vivo</italic> and is sufficient to induce upregulation of the expression of a luciferase gene reporter upon Mef2 binding following KCl and BDNF stimulation. Despite its functional importance, it is unclear whether MBS10 is located within a promoter or a long-range enhancer sequence. Fine mapping of the transcriptional start site should allow discrimination between these two possibilities.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>miRNAs of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster are necessary for activity-dependent neuronal development</title><p>Anti-miR-mediated inhibition of several members of the miR379&#x02013;410 showed that at least three of them (miR-134, -329 and -381) are necessary for dendritic outgrowth triggered by KCl in hippocampal neurons. The functional consequences of activity-dependent expression of the other members of miR379&#x02013;410 remain to be determined. A variety of programmes are triggered by neuronal activity, such as cell survival or synapse remodelling. Thus, it is conceivable that multiple aspects of activity-dependent development are controlled by the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. Consistently, the sequence of the mature miRNAs is significantly divergent and a recent bioinformatic study revealed a limited degree of overlap in the GO annotations of the different miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Glazov <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Recently, altered biogenesis of miR-134 and other members of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster has been described in a mouse model of the human microdeletion of the 22q11.2 chromosomal locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Stark <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Mice hemizygous for the deletion showed several behavioural and cognitive deficits accompanied by abnormal dendritic arbourization in the hippocampus. This animal model further indicates that the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster has a crucial function in dendritic morphogenesis.</p><p>Mef2 negatively regulates synapse number in mature hippocampal neurons and miR-134, the best characterized member of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster, negatively regulates dendritic spine size. This suggests that the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster could also be involved in the Mef2-dependent control of synapse number at later stages of neuronal development. The role of Mef2 in dendritogenesis was previously unknown, presumably as Mef2 is required only for dendrite outgrowth upon neuronal activation. The dual function of Mef2 as a positive regulator of dendritogenesis and negative regulator of synapse number appears at first glance paradoxical. One possible explanation is that at different stages of neuronal development Mef2 might regulate different sets of target genes. Indeed, known Mef2 targets include both dendrite growth-promoting factors, such as BDNF, and negative regulators of synapse formation and strength, such as Arc and SynGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Flavell and Greenberg, 2008</xref>). A recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study suggests that Mef2 is a key component of a compensatory mechanism that couples structural plasticity with sensitized response to cocaine in striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Pulipparacharuvil <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that the apparently opposing effects of Mef2 on hippocampal neurons are in fact components of the same homoeostatic circuit that controls the overall neuronal excitability, by both decreasing synapse number and promoting dendritic outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Turrigiano, 2007</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that Mef2 targets such as miR-134 display a similar dichotomy. MiR-134 is necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis and negatively regulates spine growth by regulating Pum2 and LimK1, respectively. Strikingly, BDNF upregulates miR-134 transcription, whereas, within the dendrite, BDNF relieves the inhibition of the known miR-134 target LimK1 to promote spine development. Therefore, synaptic stimulation might elevate miR-134 expression throughout the cell while inactivating miR-134 locally within stimulated spines. This could be a mechanism to permit spine growth specifically at active synapses without changing the overall excitability of the neuron.</p><p>In recent studies, the CREB-regulated miR-132 was shown to control activity-dependent dendritic growth by regulating the Rho family GTPase-activating protein p250GAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Vo <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cheng <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Wayman <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Thus, at least two independent miRNA pathways coordinately regulate dendritic plasticity. Further studies are necessary to analyse the extent of cross-talk between CREB- and Mef2-regulated miRNA pathways in dendrite development.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pum2 is a new miR-134 target necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis</title><p>We have shown that the RNA-binding protein Pum2 is a new <italic>bona fide</italic> miR-134 target. The presence of predicted binding sites for other members of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster in the Pum2 3&#x02032;UTR suggested that multiple miRNAs are necessary to robustly downregulate Pum2 after membrane depolarization. However, miR-134 alone appears to be sufficient to fine-tune Pum2 levels within a functionally critical window. Therefore, we favour the idea that other miR379&#x02013;410 miRNAs might be involved in the regulation of different aspects of activity-dependent dendritogenesis (e.g. membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, etc.) by fine-tuning critical regulators of these pathways. Interestingly, a number of predicted miR379&#x02013;410 target mRNAs have been associated with dendrite morphogenesis. For example, members of the SMAD and kinesin families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Guo <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Satoh <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) are predicted targets of miR-329 and -381, respectively (Targetscan 3.0). Future studies will reveal whether fine-tuning of these genes is a common regulatory function of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster.</p><p>The epistasis experiments in hippocampal neurons validate the functional relevance of the Pum2&#x02013;miR-134 interaction. Both inhibition and overexpression of miR-134 and Pum2 compromise activity-dependent dendritogenesis. Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral neurons, both depletion and ectopic expression of Pum have a detrimental effect on dendrite morphogenesis. Taken together, these findings support the idea that although Pum2 expression is necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis, a careful control of its levels by miR-134 is equally critical for the correct elaboration of the dendritic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Ye <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Thus, the miR-134&#x02013;Pum2 relationship in membrane-depolarized neurons might be best described by the recently proposed tuning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hobert, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Karres <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In this model, an miRNA buffers the target protein levels within a critical window that is optimal for the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6G</xref>). An important implication of the tuning model is that it takes into account the spatial regulation of miRNA targets, for example, during local protein synthesis in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tsang <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). As both the Pum2 mRNA and protein are localized in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Vessey <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Zhong <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), it is possible that Pum2 and miR-134 functionally interact within this compartment. Pum2 is a translational repressor and a component of somatic and dendritic RNA granules, in particular stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Vessey <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Therefore, miR-134, by downregulating the Pum2 protein, might induce the redistribution of Pum2 target mRNAs to the local protein synthesis machinery. Interesting candidates are known <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pum targets, such as eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), PSD-95 homologues and a voltage-gated sodium channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Mee <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Menon <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have identified the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster as a new activity-regulated Mef2 target gene, the expression of which is necessary for dendritic plasticity in hippocampal neurons.</p><p>These results represent a road map to investigate the function of these miRNAs in activity-dependent processes <italic>in vivo</italic> and to understand how a neuron coordinates local regulation of protein synthesis with global control of gene expression to properly adapt to its environment.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Single cell fluorescent sensor constructs were generated by subcloning of an <italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Not</italic>I flanked dsRED cassette (Clontech) together with a <italic>Not</italic>I&#x02013;<italic>Xba</italic>I flanked oligonucleotide containing two perfectly complementary sites to the miRNA of interest, into <italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Xba</italic>I linearized pTracer-CMV (Invitrogen).</p><p>The Pum2 3&#x02032;UTR was amplified from a rat brain cDNA library and cloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I site of pGL3promoter vector (Promega).

Note the reduced Pum2 signal in the cell transfected with Si-Pum2-2 (left) compared with the control neuron (right). Scale bar: 10 &#x003bc;m. (<bold>C</bold>) Pum2 knockdown by siRNA rescues the miR-134 loss-of-function phenotype in membrane-depolarized hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were transfected with GFP in conjunction with the indicated anti-miRs (50 nM) and shRNA constructs (2 ng). At 7DIV, neurons were incubated with 16 mM KCl for 6 h and dendritic complexity was evaluated 3 days later. Scale bar: 20 &#x003bc;m.

(<bold>G</bold>) Schematic diagram of the fine-tuning of Pum2 levels by miR-134 in membrane-depolarized neurons, see main text for details. (<bold>H</bold>) Model for the miR379&#x02013;410 activity-dependent dendritogenesis pathway. Neuronal activity activates Mef2 which in turn induces the expression of the miR379&#x02013;410 cluster. Several members of the cluster are necessary for activity-dependent dendritogenesis. Among them is miR-134, which binds to the Pum2 mRNA and downregulates its translation. Lower levels of the translational repressor Pum2 allow for the translation of a set of so far unknown mRNAs that are likely positive regulators of dendrite outgrowth.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj200910f6"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
