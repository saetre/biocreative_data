While the impact of co-stimulatory molecules has been addressed in various studies, the role of co-inhibitory receptors has not been tested. The ITIM-bearing CEACAM1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by a variety of immune cells, including B, T and NK cells. Using <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, we analyzed the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of CEACAM1 during acute and latent murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection. During acute lytic replication, we observed lower virus titers in the lungs of <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice than in WT mice. In contrast, during latency amplification, <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice displayed increased splenomegaly and a higher latent viral load in the spleen. Analysis of the immune response revealed increased virus-specific antibody levels in <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, while the magnitude of the T cell-mediated antiviral immune response was reduced.

This highly glycosylated protein is abundantly expressed in epithelia, vessel endothelia and leukocytes. In most CEACAM1-expressing cell types, the molecule occurs in two major splice variants differing in their cytoplasmic domain, called CEACAM1-L and CEACAM1-S. The &#x02018;L&#x02019;-isoforms encompass approximately 70 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain, including tyrosines that are part of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). After tyrosine phosphorylation, CEACAM1-L can bind SH2 domain-containing proteins, thereby activating Src-family tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Brummer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Skubitz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Huber1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the absence of CEACAM1 resulted in a more severe splenomegaly which could be due to increased proliferation and/or enhanced recruitment of cells. Indeed, the abnormal increase in absolute numbers of certain lymphocytes correlated with the amount of CEACAM1 on lymphocytes of the different subpopulations. B cells which constitutively express CEACAM1 were most abundant in <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice after infection. In contrast, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells which express CEACAM1 only for a certain time span upon activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Nakajima1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> increased much less. Greicius and coworkers reported that CEACAM1-mediated signals, induced by cross-linking with anti-CEACAM1 antibodies, facilitate B cell proliferation and antibody production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Greicius1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether this apparent discrepancy is due to differences of <italic>in vitro</italic> as opposed to <italic>in vivo</italic> B cell stimulation or to additional regulatory cells present <italic>in vivo</italic> has to be elucidated. The different effects of CEACAM1-mediated growth control on B versus T cells may lead to a bias of the immune response. Alternatively, signaling through CEACAM1 may directly regulate the bias of the immune response by facilitating a Th1 immune response. This is supported by our previous observation that CEACAM1 signaling in murine DC facilitates MHC-II-restricted priming of na&#x000ef;ve CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with a Th1-biased polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Kammerer2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in the absence of CEACAM1, a type2 immune response might be favored, as indicated by the higher titer of virus-specific antibodies, the lower level of virus-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and the trend towards a decreased IFN-&#x003b3; to IL-5 ratio.</p><p>Since we analyzed the consequences of the complete absence of CEACAM1 isoforms on the course of a gammaherpesvirus infection, we cannot attribute the observed effects to a specific isoform of CEACAM1. However, the fact that CEACAM1-L exceeds the levels of CEACAM1-S in immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Singer1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, and that the inhibitory function of CEACAM1-L overrules the function of the short isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Chen3">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, indicates that the alterations of the immune response are mainly due to the absence of CEACAM1-L.</p><p>What is the underlying mechanism of the reduced virus-specific T cell response in <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice during the latent phase of MHV-68 infection? One possibility is that the negative signal provided by CEACAM1 during the early phase of the immune response may prevent an overwhelming T cell activation in WT mice. Loss of CEACAM1, therefore, could result in exhausted T cells that cannot further control chronic virus infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006317-Barber1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Our experiments which identified CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses to an &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; T cell epitope suggest that the survival time of T cells which are activated in the absence of a co-inhibitory molecule may be shorter and, hence, the control of long lasting infections may be impaired.</p><p>In summary, due to an altered immune response, <italic>Ceacam1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice displayed an enhanced control of the acute lytic MHV-68 lung infection but elevated splenic viral loads and increased splenomegaly during latency amplification. Therefore, interference with CEACAM1 function during gammaherpesvirus infections of humans, perhaps in combination with interference with other inhibitory receptors, might have clinical value in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and virus stocks</title><p>BHK-21 cells were grown in Glasgow-MEM (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS), 5&#x00025; tryptose phosphate broth, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL streptomycin.
