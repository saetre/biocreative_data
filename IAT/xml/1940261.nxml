Depending on disease type, pathogenic mechanisms may vary, but all disorders have in common that the transition to illness appears to be a cell-intrinsic process, which is initiated by intergenerational or somatic repeat expansion or both. Although substantial progress has been made by the study of expansion behavior and associated pathophysiological events in repeat-containing bacterial and yeast model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], translation of findings to the mammalian system is not easy and there is still disagreement over the contribution to CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat expansion by new strand synthesis during DNA replication or DNA repair and recombination in cycling or quiescent cells for the various diseases. Also effects of cell-type and cell-state during development, adulthood and aging are generally not well understood. Yet, exactly this knowledge is needed to aid in the development of therapeutic modalities.</p><p>Since the discovery of its molecular defect, DM1 has been an archetypal case within the group of unstable trinucleotide diseases. In DM1 both progenitor CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat length and somatic expansion determine age of onset and severity of disease, which is characterized by muscular dystrophy and myotonia in combination with a highly variable manifestation of features like cataract, heart conduction defects, insulin insensitivity and cognitive impairment. The DM1 mutation is an expansion of a CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat in the 3' UTR of the <italic>DMPK </italic>gene on chromosome 19. Once DM1 alleles are in the disease-associated size range (&#x0003e;50 CTG&#x02022;CAG repeats), repeat tracts become dramatically unstable. Intergenerational mutation rates may be almost 100% per generation, with a tendency towards further repeat gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The DM1 repeat is also somatically unstable and extensive instability in a wide range of human tissues is what makes DM1 a truly unique trinucleotide disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Somatic expansion is mediated by multiple small length changes in a highly deterministic process which is clearly age-dependent, with longer average DM1 repeat length and broader ranges of variability observed in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We know that somatic expansions accumulate in both proliferating and post-mitotic tissues, suggesting that expansion is independent of cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the rate of instability of the CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat in DM1 is correlated to repeat length and is probably due to an increased ability of the repeat sequence to form aberrant DNA structures, such as slipped strand structures with out-of-register alignment of the complementary strands, cruciforms or intramolecular triplex and quadruplex structures with single-stranded regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Failure in the processing of these structures, a cascade of reactions in which mismatch repair proteins &#x02013; e.g., MSH2, MSH3, PMS2 or MLH1 &#x02013; likely play a role, may underlie mutagenic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Aberrant DNA break repair induced by these structures may also be at the basis of instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, c<italic>is</italic>-acting factors such as nearby replication origins or CpG islands may influence instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We here report on an analysis towards the role of cell type and cell stage in CTG&#x02022;CAG instability in different tissues of a mouse knock-in DM1 model, where a human (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n </sub>repeat segment (n ~ 110) replaces the cognate 3' segment of the endogenous mouse <italic>Dmpk </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We concentrated on tissues that continuously divide and tissues with non-cycling cells that undergo terminal maturation early in life or during aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our group has developed a knock-in mouse model in which somatic expansion of the DM1 CTG&#x02022;CAG tract is faithfully reproduced. In this animal model a short segment of human chromosomal DNA spanning the exon 13&#x02013;15 region of the <italic>DMPK </italic>gene of a DM1 patient with an abnormal (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>84 </sub>repeat replaces the exact cognate segment of the endogenous mouse <italic>Dmpk </italic>gene. Hence, this places chromatin embedding of the repeat element and production of repeat containing DMPK mRNA under "natural" host control. Study of this model revealed that the mutability of the repeat is age-dependent and activity of the mismatch repair protein Msh3 (usually found associated in the Msh2/Msh3 MutS&#x003b2; repair complex) is important for repeat expansion, whereas the Msh6 protein (found in association with Msh2 in the MutS&#x003b1; complex) appears dispensable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In this model, we now analyzed the cell-type and cell-stage dependence of CTG&#x02022;CAG instability in different tissues in more detail. Analysis of PCR-amplified DMPK repeat segments originating from tissues with a moderate to low fraction of cycling cells like skin, bone marrow or heart showed a typical Gaussian distribution of allele sizes, slowly expanding to greater average length during aging (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). In contrast, tissues with a rather high repeat expansion rate, like kidney and stomach, displayed a significant broadening of the profile (see data presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]), while liver and pancreas displayed a typical bimodal distribution profile (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1BC</xref>). Typically, after about six months of age the fraction of cells with no or moderately expanded alleles remained constant, but alleles in the already expanded pool of cells continued to increase in length. As the bimodal profile in liver and pancreas became increasingly pronounced with age, we considered effects of terminal differentiation and aging the best explanation for this phenomenon, rather than cell-type differences or tissue heterogeneity. Polyploidization, which is the state of acquiring a greater than diploid content of DNA, is one of few distinct events that mark physiologically normal late differentiation and is a distinguishing feature of liver hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We therefore decided to concentrate on these cell types and analyze whether changes in cell nuclearity, hyperploidy or G2 state &#x02013; or any state where two identical chromosome copies of the expanded CTG&#x02022;CAG tract would coexist in one cell &#x02013; could selectively affect repeat hypermutability via effects on homology-directed DNA recombination or repair.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of aging on the somatic CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat length distribution in heart, liver and pancreas</bold>.

We employed a two-step collagenase perfusion protocol to disperse liver into single hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] (see Methods). Single hepatocytes were isolated and FACS fractionation was employed to sort the cell suspension in pools of 2n (diploid, mononuclear), 4n or 8n cells (both populations contained mononuclear and binuclear cells; collectively called polyploid) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,C</xref> inset). By analyzing the length distribution of PCR products from the repeat area on PAGE gels, and comparing peak areas in typical profiles as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, we estimate that over 95% of hepatocytes in the 4 and the 8n cell pools harbored large expanded repeat alleles, whereas the majority of cells in the diploid cell pool carried repeats with progenitor allele size or only marginal length expansions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Comparison of different animals showed that less than 15&#x02013;20% of the cells in the diploid pool harbored expansions and the percentage of expanded cells seemed to drop further with age. The typical overrepresentation of mutant alleles in the 4n and 8n cell pools was already apparent around six months of age when the polyploidization process had stopped, but the average repeat size increased further during aging (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, and see data in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). As a cautionary note, we would like to stress here that the procedures used for liberation of single dispersed cells from tissue and the ploidy-sorting will not yield absolutely pure populations as cell aggregation and shearing cannot be avoided completely, and also cell cycle state (i.e., G0 or G2 phase) may affect the sorting efficiency. Yet, it is striking that expansion fate in the &#x02265;4n pools always appeared much more homogeneous than that in the 2n pools, where 10&#x02013;20% of cells appeared expanded. Importantly, the time course of genesis of 4n and 8n liver cells, and hence the postnatal development and maintenance of the polyploidization profile in our CTG&#x02022;CAG knock-in lineage occurred as in wild type mice and was essentially completed within the first four months of life. Approximately 50% of all liver cells became tetraploid-octaploid, with a 20% versus 80% ratio between mono- and binuclearity (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, data not shown). We thus may assume that the end-stage of differentiation in liver of our model is reached via a physiologically normal and step-wise process, with creation of binuclear cells preceding the formation of mononuclear tetraploid cells, as has been described in detail for rat liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Correlation between age, somatic expansion, ploidy and nuclearity in DM1 knock-in mice</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Age*</td><td align="center" colspan="3">1 &#x02013; 3 months</td><td align="center" colspan="3">12 &#x02013; 25 months</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Somatic Expansion</td><td align="center" colspan="3">no</td><td align="center" colspan="3">yes</td></tr><tr><td colspan="7"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="center">Ploidy</td><td align="center">2n</td><td align="center">4n</td><td align="center">8n</td><td align="center">2n</td><td align="center">4n</td><td align="center">8n</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">54 &#x000b1; 9%</td><td align="center">45 &#x000b1; 8%</td><td align="center">2 &#x000b1; 2%</td><td align="center">45 &#x000b1; 5%</td><td align="center">43 &#x000b1; 3%</td><td align="center">13 &#x000b1; 3%</td></tr><tr><td align="center">Nuclearity</td><td align="center">100% mononuclear</td><td align="center">80% binuclear</td><td align="center">n.d.</td><td align="center">100% mononuclear</td><td align="center">80% binuclear</td><td align="center">80% binuclear</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* n = 5 for 1&#x02013;3 months-old mice and n = 8 for 12&#x02013;25 months-old mice; n.d., not determined</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Polyploid cells in liver and pancreas display enhanced somatic instability of the CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat</bold>.

In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> we show gel mobility analyses on PCR products from 2n and 4n pancreatic acinar cells collected after FACS analysis. Virtually all cells (&#x0003e;99%) in these preparations had retained typical acinar cell attributes including zymogen granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, inset). Notably, again a very high proportion of 2n cells (estimated fraction &#x0003e;90%) yielded signals in the original CTG&#x02022;CAG size range, whereas alleles in the 4n acinar cells almost all were of higher length (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>; less than 5% of 4n acinar cells contained alleles in the (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>108 </sub>range).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although our data are of associative nature, our observations strongly suggest that polyploidization is not a condition that is directly involved in the expansion process per se, but merely establishes a cell state that must be reached before repeat expansion can be promoted later in life. If this cell state &#x02013; considered the end-state of differentiation &#x02013; is reached gradually and late in life of diploid cells, the ability to expand may even become manifest before the actual transition to multinuclearity or polyploidy. This would explain why a small proportion (10&#x02013;15%) of 2n hepatocytes harbour expanded alleles and that this proportion appears higher in early adulthood than at very old age. In mouse liver, already after few months of age a new end-state of differentiation is reached, and the fraction of multinucleate or polyploid cells does not increase further. Repeat expansion appears to continue over the entire life span of the animal, however (results shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). When taken together, these observations link expansion most tightly to the post-replicative state, as polyploid cells in liver and pancreas are non-cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Expansion appears also transcription independent, as the <italic>Dmpk gen</italic>e is expressed at very low levels in hepatocytes and appears fully repressed in acinar cells [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], own findings, unpublished]. Also other cell types that show polyploidization, like arterial smooth muscle cells, cardiomyocytes and Purkinje cells are generally non-cycling and it will therefore become important to study repeat fate also in these cells. Unfortunately, there are no good experimental protocols available for their isolation, cultivation, and separation into 2n or &#x02265;4n cell pools, so this remains work to be done for the future.</p><p>Interestingly, reciprocal correlations exist between the cell state and its DNA recombination-repair capacity that may affect repeat stability. Checkpoint degeneracy with an interesting change in the survey role of p53 has been observed after transition to tetraploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We have observed changes in the level of DNA recombination-repair protein RPA, which parallel the process of terminal differentiation and aging of liver (data not shown). A deficiency of DNA repair protein ERCC1 in mice results in accelerated polyploidization rates in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Vice versa, polyploidization and associated changes in either cell size, or the process of aging itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], may alter cellular metabolism, thereby contributing to changes in the genetic stability of terminally differentiated cells. Metabolic effects on the activities of MLH1 and MutS&#x003b1;, components of the mismatch repair machinery that determine trinucleotide repeat stability, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and activity of DNA repair proteins, like Ku, is modulated during aging in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Based on these observations and our findings reported here, additional investigations are warranted to understand how changes in both cell nuclearity and DNA ploidy correlate to altered efficacy of the machinery that controls somatic CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat stability in DM1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of liver hepatocytes</title><p>Hepatocytes were isolated using a two-step collagenase liver perfusion protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Cells were resuspended in Hepes buffer with 1% (w/v) BSA, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, whereafter the last step was repeated.</p></sec><sec><title>FACS analysis</title><p>Single cells were fixed in 70% (v/v) ethanol overnight at -20&#x000b0;C. After a PBS wash, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 20 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/ml RNase and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by a 15 min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were excited at 488 nm and emission was measured at 610 nm using a Beckman Coulter Epics Elite ESP. Diploid, tetraploid and octaploid cells were sorted and isolated. The average number of polyploid hepatocytes in our adult mice ranged between ~50&#x02013;70% and remained stable after five months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>PAS staining</title><p>To control for purity of our cell population, isolated pancreatic acinar cells were attached on superfrost plus slides and fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formol (pH 7). Slides were stained for 5 min in periodic acid solution and for 15 min in Schiff solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Autofluorescence from PAS-positive structures was recorded using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. Typical preparations obtained, were estimated &#x0003e;99% pure.</p></sec><sec><title>CTG&#x02022;CAG repeat length analysis</title><p>DNA was isolated after proteinase K treatment, phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. DNA concentrations in different samples were equilibrated in accordance with the number and ploidy of cells used in the sorted population(s) and PCR was performed with forward primer 226 (5'-GAAGGGTCCTTGTAGCCGGGAA-3') and Cy5-labeled reverse primer 225 (5'-GGAGGATGGAACACGGACGG-3') flanking the CTG&#x02022;CAG tract. PCR products were analyzed on a 6% denaturing acrylamide-urea gel in the ALF DNA sequencing (Amersham Pharmacia) system. PCR products obtained from amplification of Each (CTG&#x02022;CAG)<sub>n </sub>repeat length profile was normalized to its highest peak to be able to optimally compare the relative contribution of fragments with expanded repeats between different profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WJAAvdB carried out the experiments.
