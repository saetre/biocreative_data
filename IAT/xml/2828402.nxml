This phenomenon is known to be inherited as a recessive trait, and is caused by accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue. Two enzymes are known to be important in carotenoid degradation in mammals, and are therefore potential candidate genes for this trait. These are <italic>beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO1) </italic>and the <italic>beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2)</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the present study the coding region of the <italic>BCMO1 </italic>and the <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene were sequenced in yellow fat individuals and compared to the corresponding sequences from control animals with white fat. In the yellow fat individuals a nonsense mutation was found in <italic>BCO2 </italic>nucleotide position 196 (<italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T</italic>), introducing a stop codon in amino acid position 66. The full length protein consists of 575 amino acids. In spite of a very low frequency of this mutation in the Norwegian AI-ram population, 16 out of 18 yellow fat lambs were found to be homozygous for this mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study a nonsense mutation (<italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T</italic>) in the <italic>beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) </italic>gene is found to strongly associate with the yellow fat phenotype in sheep. The existence of individuals lacking this mutation, but still demonstrating yellow fat, suggests that additional mutations may cause a similar phenotype in this population. The results demonstrate a quantitatively important role for BCO2 in carotenoid degradation, which might indicate a broad enzyme specificity for carotenoids. Animals homozygous for the mutation are not reported to suffer from any negative health or development traits, pointing towards a minor role of BCO2 in vitamin A formation.

Animals are unable to synthesise vitamin A <italic>de novo</italic>, and are therefore dependent on metabolising &#x003b2;-carotene, and other carotenoids, into vitamin A. The central step in formation of vitamin A is the enzymatic cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene. Two key enzymes responsible for this have been characterised at the molecular level in multiple organisms, including mammals. These are the <italic>beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase 1 </italic>(<italic>BCMO1</italic>) responsible for the symmetric cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene into two molecules of retinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and the <italic>beta-carotene oxygenase 2 </italic>(<italic>BCO2</italic>) responsible for the asymmetric cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene into &#x003b2;-apo-10'-carotenal (C<sub>27</sub>) and &#x003b2;-ionone (C<sub>13</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Some recent studies have confirmed that naturally occurring mutations in <italic>BCMO1 </italic>and <italic>BCO2 </italic>have significant impact on the carotenoid metabolism in diverse organisms. In domestic chicken, yellow skin was found to be caused by a regulatory mutation that inhibits expression of the <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene in skin, allowing deposition of yellow carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In cows, the introduction of a premature stop codon in the <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene caused an increased level of &#x003b2;-caroten in milk and serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In humans, four SNPs in or close to the <italic>BCMO1 </italic>gene showed a robust association to &#x003b2;-carotene plasma levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Several reports have concluded that 'yellow fat' in lamb carcasses is inherited as a simple recessive trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A deficiency in the 'xanthophyll oxidase' system was early suggested as a probable explanation of this trait in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Based upon this, and the above mentioned studies of genetic variation in the <italic>BCMO1/BCO2 </italic>genes, we hypothesised that a mutation in one of these genes could explain the recessively inherited yellow fat observed in Norwegian sheep. In the present study we have sequenced the coding region of both <italic>BCMO1 </italic>and <italic>BCO2 </italic>in yellow fat sheep and white fat control animals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sequencing of the BCMO1 coding region in the two ewes giving yellow fat offspring, together with the control ewe, did not reveal any genetic differences that were likely to explain the yellow fat phenotype (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FN543098">FN543098</ext-link>).</p><p>Comparing the coding part of the <italic>BCO2 </italic>cDNA sequence in 2 white fat control lambs (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FN257486">FN257486</ext-link>) and 4 yellow fat (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="FN257487">FN257487</ext-link>) lambs collected from the abattoir, a substitution of cytosine with thymine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) was identified in nucleotide position 196 (nt-numbering according to translation start codon) in 3 out of 4 yellow fat lambs. This substitution (<italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T</italic>) introduced a stop codon in amino acid position 66. Based on the bovine gene structure, the location of the nonsense mutation is predicted to be in the second exon of the <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Additional non-synonymous substitutions were observed downstream of the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), but we assume that this part of the protein is not translated in the animals homozygous for <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T</italic>.

In spite of the low allele frequency of this mutation among the 411 NWS AI rams (0.0134), 16 out of 18 yellow fat individuals were homozygous for this mutation, and both ewes with yellow fat offspring were heterozygous. The low frequency of the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>allele among the AI rams indicates a low frequency also in the NWS ewe population. An AI ram must be mated to a ewe with one or two copies of the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>allele to possibly be revealed as a carrier by progeny testing. If we assume a similar allele frequency among the ewes, less than 3% of the ewes will carry the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>allele. This may explain why only 3 out of 9 AI rams with one or two copies of the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>allele were revealed to have yellow fat allele(s) by progeny testing.</p><p>While the mutant allele encodes a truncated protein of only 65 amino acid residues, the <italic>BCO2 </italic>protein length in the control animals is 575 amino acids. It can therefore be hypothesised that the mutant <italic>BCO2 </italic>version generates a non-functional enzyme. However, we cannot completely exclude the possible existence of functional splice variants of <italic>BCO2</italic>. In that case, a closely linked mutation outside the <italic>BCO2 </italic>coding region could be the causal one. However, splicing out the second exon, harbouring the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>nonsense mutation, will reduce the protein size by at least 68 amino acids (positions 30-97), assuming an intron/exon structure similar to the bovine <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Such a large rearrangement will most likely impair enzyme function, and we consider this as a less likely scenario, given that the generation of a truncated protein of 65 amino acids can fully explain the observed phenotype.</p><p>Based on our findings, and the fact that <italic>BCO2 </italic>mutations in chicken and cattle have resulted in accumulation of carotenoids in skin and milk/serum respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we suggest that this mutation is causing the yellow fat phenotype in the majority of the NWS individuals observed. A loss of function mutation like this is also in agreement with the recessive inheritance of yellow fat in sheep reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, two lambs found to have the yellow fat phenotype did not display this genetic mutation. One of these lambs was sequenced (5013), and it was noticed that the haplotype of the 6 polymorphic amino acid positions of this lamb differed from the controls only in being homozygous FF at amino acid position 315 and heterozygous NI at amino acid position 422 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Whether one of these differences, or additional mutations outside the <italic>BCO2 </italic>coding region, is causing the yellow fat phenotype is not possible to determine based on these two individuals. The fact that 7 AI rams were progeny tested to have yellow fat allele(s) without having the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>mutation, may also point towards a possible existence of additional mutations causing yellow fat in this population. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of erroneous classification of an AI ram with regard to yellow fat status, caused by wrong parentage assignment of a yellow fat litter.</p><p>In an earlier paper the amount of carotenoids in perirenal fat in three typical Norwegian 'yellow fat' animals was estimated to be 220 &#x003bc;g/100 g fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the same study, the concentration of total carotenoid in perirenal fat was found to vary between 12 and 236 &#x003bc;g/100 g fat, with a good correlation (r = 0.85) between visual score and measured amounts of total carotenoid. Based on the visual appearance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), the amount of carotenoids deposited in the adipose tissue in yellow fat individuals is considerably elevated compared to the control animals, indicating a significant role of the BCO2 enzyme in carotenoid degradation in quantitative terms. This is also in agreement with the observation that cows homozygous for a similar deleterious <italic>BCO2 </italic>mutation produce milk with 78% more &#x003b2;-carotene compared to cows without the mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The yellow fat phenotype in sheep</bold>. The picture is showing a typical yellow fat carcass in front of a normal coloured carcass.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2156-11-10-3"/></fig><p>The main carotenoids in adipose tissue from yellow fat sheep are lutein and flavoxanthin, while only small amounts of &#x003b2;-carotene are found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A study of cleavage activity for recombinant <italic>BCMO1 </italic>indicate that &#x003b2;-carotene is much more efficiently cleaved compared to other carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The present results may indicate that the BCO2 enzyme is a less selective carotenoid cleaver. If so, this would explain why the BCO2 function seems to be quantitatively important for carotenoid degradation in tissues with a high non-&#x003b2;-carotene content, in spite of an apparently functional <italic>BCMO1 </italic>gene.</p><p>The relative importance of symmetric versus asymmetric cleavage of &#x003b2;-carotene in vitamin A formation has been debated for a long time. Recent knockout studies in zebrafish and mice have strongly indicated that <italic>BCMO1 </italic>is the key enzyme in production of vitamin A from &#x003b2;-carotene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A similar study in mice also indicated that <italic>BCMO1 </italic>plays a major role in conversion of &#x003b2;-carotene to retinoids, but the authors did not exclude a possible contribution of other enzymes like e.g. eccentric cleavage enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It was recently shown that a deleterious mutation in the bovine <italic>BCO2 </italic>gene caused an increased level of &#x003b2;-carotene in milk and serum, and a reduced level of vitamin A in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, neither the cows nor the sheep seem to encounter any adverse developmental or health effects as a result of having an impaired BCO2 function. This does not exclude the possibility that BCO2 might play a role in vitamin A formation in these ruminants, but its contribution seems not to be indispensable.</p><p>Although the presence of increased amounts of carotenoids in adipose tissue is not known to negatively affect the sheep, or the sheep meat consumers, it constitutes a marketing problem due to the visual appearance. In the Norwegian sheep breeding scheme this has until now been handled by culling sires giving yellow fat offspring. According to Animalia - Meat and Poultry Research Centre, the frequency of yellow fat lamb carcasses in Norway was only 0.02% in 2008. This implies it is hard to identify individuals carrying heritable yellow fat, simply because the probability of mating two carriers is very low. Selection against this trait has now been made more efficient by genotyping all potential AI-rams for the presence of the <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>mutation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The majority of yellow fat individuals are found to be homozygous for the low frequency <italic>BCO2 c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>mutation, which most likely results in a truncated and functionally impaired protein. We therefore suggest that this mutation is a cause of yellow fat in sheep. However, two lambs with yellow fat and 7 AI rams progeny tested to have yellow fat allele(s) did not have this mutation, suggesting that additional mutations might exist in this population. The large difference in carotenoid content between yellow and white fat carcasses show that BCO2 mediated degradation of carotenoids is quantitatively important. The reason might be that BCO2 have a broader specificity for carotenoids other than &#x003b2;-carotene, compared to BCMO1. No adverse health or development effects are reported on yellow fat animals, suggesting a non-essential BCO2 contribution in vitamin A formation. Culling AI rams carrying <italic>c.196C&#x0003e;T </italic>will reduce the problem with yellow fat in populations having this mutation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Liver samples of approximately 0.5 &#x000d7; 0.5 cm was collected in RNA<italic>later</italic>&#x02122; (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) from 2 ewes that both have given birth to yellow fat lambs, together with a randomly selected control animal (typical phenotypes are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).
