Efflux pumps represent one class of integral membrane transport proteins in bacteria that confer antibiotic resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. These proteins actively detoxify the intracellular space by exporting drugs to the cell exterior.

However, despite all mutational and structural studies to date, the mechanism explaining how substrates are transported into the extracellular media was still unclear.</p><p>The use of antibody fragments as crystallization aids for membrane proteins has yielded a number of crystal structures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The binding of such antibody fragments enlarges the hydrophilic extramembranal surface of integral membrane proteins, thereby providing additional surface for crystal contacts. They can also stabilize a specific conformation supporting the crystallization process. The drawback of the antibody fragment approach is that it is not always easy to get an antibody fragment that recognizes and binds to a particular conformation of a membrane protein. Further, the selected antibody fragment might be unstable or production might be difficult. To circumvent these problems, we applied an approach based on designed ankyrin-repeat proteins (DARPins) as an alternative to antibody fragments. DARPins can be selected to bind almost any given target protein with high affinity and specificity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. They are very stable and can be produced as soluble proteins in large amounts by bacterial expression. As DARPins interact with their target protein with an exposed interaction surface, they tend to bind to conformational epitopes rather than to peptidic ones. These characteristics make DARPins ideal tools to help the structural studies of membrane proteins.</p><p>Here we selected DARPins that not only bind to AcrB but also inhibit bacterial drug export. Crystals of a selected AcrB&#x02013;DARPin complex were obtained, and the structure was determined at 2.5-&#x000c5; resolution. It is the first structure of an integral membrane protein with a selected DARPin molecule binder. The structure reveals a previously unknown asymmetric conformation of the efflux pump, in which each of the three subunits has a unique well-defined conformation. The internal asymmetry of AcrB is underlined by the fact that only two of the three subunits of AcrB are recognized by DARPins in crystallo and in solution and is in contrast to the 3-fold symmetric structures reported to date &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. The structural features described here together with the enhanced resolution allow us to deduce a pathway for drug export and a mechanism for the coupling of substrate export with proton import.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>DARPin Selection and Inhibitor Screening</title><p>DARPin binders were selected in vitro by ribosome display using a designed ankyrin-repeat protein library &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The selection was performed on purified and in vitro biotinylated AcrB under native conditions. Four rounds of ribosome display were sufficient to select a pool of specific DARPins binding to AcrB. These experiments are to our knowledge the first ribosome display selections performed in the presence of detergent to select specific binders to an integral membrane protein.</p><p>The pool of specific binders was subjected to an in vivo screen, based on replica plating, to identify those AcrB-binding DARPins which lead to an inhibitory phenotype. As AcrB is crucial for the transport of certain substrates, its inhibition will consequently lead to accumulation of substrates in the bacterial cell and consequently to cell death. We chose Rhodamine 6G (R6G) as substrate for AcrB. The enriched pool after four rounds of ribosome display was cloned into an expression plasmid under the control of an isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter. <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain XL1-blue was transformed and plated under nonselective conditions, in absence of R6G. About 1,500 colonies were subsequently replica-plated under selective conditions, in the presence of 32 &#x003bc;g/ml R6G. By this procedure, 18 single clones were identified which showed a rhodamine-sensitive phenotype. These selected clones were sequenced and assayed for expression. Analysis of the sequences showed that all 18 clones were different and unique.</p><p>The affinities of the AcrB inhibiting DARPins were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biacore.com">http://www.biacore.com</ext-link>) instrument. The analysis was performed on AcrB-coated sensor surfaces with multiple concentrations of the DARPins and was evaluated with a global kinetic fit. The five inhibitors with highest affinity, having dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range (3.6 to 98.9 nM; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), were chosen for further characterization.

All inhibitors showed a significant increase of the sensitivity compared to cells expressing an unselected nonbinding DARPin, termed E3&#x0005f;5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. This control also showed that the expression of a nonbinding DARPin per se has no influence on R6G sensitivity or bacterial growth. The <italic>acrB</italic> gene-deletion strain KAM3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d; causes hypersensitivity to R6G and was used as a sensitivity control. In absence of R6G, DARPins conferring R6G sensitivity did not influence <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> growth by themselves. It should be noted, however, that the affinity of the inhibitors does not always correlate with the inhibition efficacy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Possible factors leading to this observation include different expression levels or different binding sites of the DARPins on AcrB. Moreover, the exact inhibition mechanism is not known, even for the inhibitor 1108&#x0005f;19 for which the structure was solved. Different inhibition mechanisms seem plausible ranging from allosteric inhibition of the rotary export mechanism of AcrB by the DARPin to simply preventing the interaction with TolC or AcrA to form the export complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Overall Structure of the AcrB&#x02013;DARPin Complex: Loss of the 3-Fold Symmetry</title><p>AcrB exists as a homotrimer, with each subunit containing 12 transmembrane (TM) helices and a large periplasmic part formed by two loops between TM helices 1 and 2 and TM helices 7 and 8. The trimer consists of three prominent domains, the TM domain, and parallel to the membrane, the adjacent pore domain and the TolC docking domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The TM domain encompasses a large central cavity, 35 &#x000c5; in diameter, through the membrane which is closed toward the central funnel formed by the TolC docking domain by three helices provided by the PN1 subdomains of the pore domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">2</xref>C). The export of substrates was proposed directly through this central pore. Several structures of ligand-free AcrB and with bound substrates have been solved at moderate resolution (between 3.5 and 3.8 &#x000c5;). Yu et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; reported structures of AcrB&#x02013;ligand complexes showing ligand binding to the upper wall in the central cavity and additional substrate binding in the periplasmic domain, compatible with mutational studies, which indicated that discrimination between different toxic substrates occurs in the periplasmic domain, rather than in the TM domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. All structures determined to date imply 3-fold symmetry and thus the three AcrB subunits displayed the same conformation.</p><p>To analyze the interaction and to characterize the inhibition property of a selected DARPin, we determined the crystal structure of one inhibitor (1108&#x0005f;19) in complex with AcrB. The crystals diffracted to 2.5-&#x000c5; resolution and belonged to space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure published by Murakami et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; as a search model without using the phases of the DARPin. The results of the data collection and refinement are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050007-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The crystal structure of the AcrB&#x02013;DARPin complex shows two DARPin molecules bound basically to two subunits, named A and B, in the homotrimeric transporter, while the third subunit, named C, is not bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">2</xref>B). Unlike previously determined crystal structures, there is no 3-fold symmetry of AcrB with the DARPin molecules stabilizing three distinct conformations of the subunits. The conformations of the DARPin-bound subunits A and B are similar to the known symmetric structure. A superposition on Protein Data Bank entry 1IWG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; shows a few differences for these two subunits with root-mean-square deviations of 1.72 &#x000c5; and 1.98 &#x000c5;, respectively, for 1,033 C&#x003b1; atoms, compared to 2.95 &#x000c5; for the third subunit C. To validate in solution the 3:2 (AcrB monomer to DARPin) stoichiometry observed in the crystal structure, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments. Single molecular weight species taking the detergent micelle into consideration were observed, with molecular masses of 374 &#x000b1; 1.6 kDa for AcrB alone and 408 &#x000b1; 1.7 kDa for the complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The mass difference indicates that AcrB in solution is bound by two DARPins, with a calculated mass of 17.8 kDa each.</p><p>As can be seen in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g002">2</xref>B), the DARPins bind mainly to the &#x003b2;-sheet connecting the pore domain with the TolC docking domain interacting, as expected, primarily through their randomized concave surface area. The interface buries a surface of around 1,000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-st001">Table S1</xref> for detailed interactions). Furthermore, each DARPin interacts with the adjacent preceding subunit of AcrB via one additional hydrophobic interaction involving Leu230 of the intersubunit connecting loop as well as two interactions involving the residues Arg263 and Lys248, again of the preceding subunit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-st001">Table S1</xref>). Subunit C is in a different orientation, and consequently no DARPin is bound. Notably, the DARPins not only stabilize the asymmetric conformation of AcrB but are also involved in direct interactions in the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), resulting in a different crystal form P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Structure Reveals Channels Leading through the Individual Subunits</title><p>The three AcrB subunits are bound in three different conformations, revealing three distinct channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The width of these channels is sufficient for the passage of typical AcrB substrates. In subunit A, a channel is observed, extending from the external depression through the large periplasmic domain reaching almost the central funnel at the top of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Here the side chains of residues Gln124, Gln125, and Tyr758 form a gate, closing the channel and therefore preventing direct access to the central funnel. The periplasmic channel entrance corresponds perfectly with the periplasmic binding site indicated in the AcrB&#x02013;ligand structures of Yu et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. A similar channel, although a little wider, is present in subunit B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In addition, the channel is open not only to the periplasm but also to the membrane bilayer at the periphery of the TM domain. In subunit C, the channel entrances are closed due to movements of PC2 and PN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). In contrast to subunits A and B, the gate to the central funnel at the top of the periplasmic domain formed by residues Gln124, Gln125, and Tyr758 is now open, allowing the substrate to enter the central funnel from where it most probably reaches TolC and is exported to the cell exterior.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Structural Rearrangements in the Putative Proton-Translocation Site</title><p>The opening and closing of the channel entrances and the gate is coupled to structural rearrangements in the putative proton-translocation site in the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) involving residues in the middle of the TM helix 4 (Asp407 and Asp408) and TM helix 10 (Lys940), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). These charged residues are localized in the center of the hydrophobic TM domain and have been shown to be essential for the proper function of AcrB, since the mutation of these residues leads to complete loss of drug resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. In subunits A and B, Lys940 forms a salt bridge to the side chains of Asp407 and Asp408, which are also involved in H-bonds with Ser481 and Thr978 presenting the same conformation described to date &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In subunit C, this salt bridge is not formed; instead Lys940 is tilted away, forming new polar contacts to Asn941 and Thr978.</p><p>The conformational changes described for the putative proton-translocation site are linked to the opening and closing of the channel entrances and the gate described above via rigid movements of TM helix 5 and TM helix 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Distinct conformational differences of the polypeptide stretch that connects the N-terminal end of TM helix 8 to PC2 can be observed in each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The functional importance of this connection is underlined by the fact that each subunit displays a different conformational state of this polypeptide stretch. In subunit A, the stretch shows a long random coil conformation, whereas in subunit B, it adopts partially a helical conformation but with still some random coil conformation. In subunit C, the polypeptide segment is in a completely &#x003b1;-helical conformation continuing the TM helix 8 up to the headpiece subdomain PC2.</p><p>The loss of the interaction of Asp407, Asp408 with Lys940 in the putative site for proton-translocation, the simultaneous closing of the channel entrances, and the opening of the gate are evident. This hints at a coordinated control or a coupling of drug export and proton-translocation. The coupling seems to occur via the polypeptide segment that connects TM helix 8 and PC2.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Comparison of Asymmetric AcrB Structures</title><p>During the review process of this manuscript, the asymmetric structure of AcrB was published by two other groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Our experimental approach, however, differs from theirs as we apply a new technology using DARPins as crystallization aid. This lead to a new crystal form, P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>, and, finally, crystals diffracting to higher resolution. Notably, the structural comparison reveals that all three independent structure determinations of AcrB resulted all in almost identical structures. The root-mean-square deviations for 1,032 C&#x003b1; atoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-st002">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sv001">Video S1</xref>) is around 1, which is a very good correlation at the given resolutions of the different structures (2J8S, 2.5 &#x000c5;; 2DHH, 2.8 &#x000c5; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;; 2GIF, 2.9 &#x000c5; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;). Importantly, the region where the DARPins bind shows no significant differences in all the structures. This clearly demonstrates that the selected DARPins bind and stabilize an existing conformational state and do not induce a nonnative conformation upon binding. Murakami et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d; also crystallized the protein in the presence of two substrates, which greatly substantiates our findings. In conclusion, all three crystal structures lead to virtually identical conclusions about the drug export pathway and we all proposed similar export mechanisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cocrystallization of the membrane protein AcrB and a DARPin inhibitor selected from a large combinatorial library resulted in crystals that diffract to high resolution. The significant higher resolution of our structure compared to the structures published to date allowed unambiguous modeling of the side chain conformations and the interpretation of structural rearrangements extending from the putative proton-translocation sites in the center of the membrane to the gate in the periplasmic domain. The quality of the structure is underlined by 11 resolved detergent molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050007-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Our work shows for the first time the structure of an integral membrane protein with a selected DARPin molecule, an experimental approach that has great potential for the structural biology of these exceedingly difficult proteins. DARPins may aid by stabilizing certain conformations and by extending the hydrophilic surface similar to antibody-derived protein fragments.</p><p>In contrast to the previously known R32 crystal form of AcrB with one monomer in the asymmetric unit, in our structure there are one AcrB trimer and two DARPins in the asymmetric unit, and therefore there are no constraints regarding the conformation of the individual subunits of AcrB. Indeed, the crystal structure shows different conformations for the three individual subunits and reveals channels extending either from the periplasm and the membrane bilayer to a gate near the central funnel at the top of the protein or as in one subunit extending from the gate directly into the central funnel. Moreover, we were able to confirm the 3:2 stoichiometry in solution, confirming the internal asymmetry of AcrB. We believe that the three conformations likely present intermediates in the transport cycle and suggest a rotary mechanism for drug transport where the three subunits strictly alternate their conformation in a concerted way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050007-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The R6G-sensitive phenotype of cells expressing the DARPin supports this hypothesis. AcrB may be locked by the DARPins and therefore the rotation of the molecule is stopped. It seems unlikely that the subunits export drugs independent of each other. If this was the case, subunit C would still be functional, and this would be in contrast to the observed inhibitory phenotype induced by the DARPin. Another possibility for the inhibitory effect of the DARPin is that either TolC or AcrA is unable to bind AcrB anymore, resulting in the loss of function of this resistance-nodulation-cell division&#x02013;type transport protein.</p><p>We believe that AcrB operates through a mechanism resembling the alternating-access mechanism which is the substrate-translocation mechanism most commonly described to secondary membrane transporters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. We propose that substrates could enter the channel in subunit B via the transmembranal groove at the periphery of the TM domain or via the external depression in the periplasmic part of the structure close to the outer leaflet of the membrane. Substrate would then be specifically bound with the gate of the channel still closed to the central funnel at the top of the periplasmic headpiece. Upon protonation of the proton gating residues Asp407 and/or Asp408, conformational changes in the TM helix 8 take place, which in turn trigger the conformational changes in the periplasmic headpiece. The channel entrances then close through movements of subdomains PN1 and PC2 opening the gate toward the central funnel at the top of the headpiece, releasing the bound substrate into the funnel, from where it could reach TolC and finally the cell exterior.</p><p>While this model is based on the interpretation of the structural information seen in the asymmetric structure, it contains all features necessary for the export of substrates and simultaneous import of protons. It is also consistent with mutational studies available to date &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Further experiments using the crystals of the complex with drug substrates may substantiate this mechanism. In fact, similar to the experiments performed by Murakami et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050007-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, we also could show binding of minocycline in the identified channel at 2.5-&#x000c5; resolution (unpublished data). The structural findings most likely rule out the previously proposed export of substrates directly through the central pore of the structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>AcrB production and purification.</title><p>AcrB was overexpressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> strain BL21 (DE3; Novagen, EMD Biosciences, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emdbiosciences.com">http://www.emdbiosciences.com</ext-link>) overnight at 30 &#x000b0;C using a pET28 vector (Novagen) containing <italic>acrB</italic> with a hexahistidine-tag at the C terminus.
