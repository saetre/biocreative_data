Because the repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa) was originally identified as an axon repellent in the visual system, diverse functions in the developing and adult central nervous system have been ascribed to it. RGMa binding to its receptor neogenin induces RhoA activation, leading to inhibitory/repulsive behavior and collapse of the neuronal growth cone. However, the precise mechanisms that regulate RhoA activation are poorly understood. In this study, we show that Unc5B, a member of the netrin receptor family, interacts with neogenin as a coreceptor for RGMa. Moreover, leukemia-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) associates with Unc5B to transduce the RhoA signal. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is involved in RGMa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG as well as RhoA activation. These findings uncover the molecular basis for diverse functions mediated by RGMa.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the nervous system, axons are guided by attractive and repulsive cues in the extracellular matrix. When these cues are detected by specific receptors present on growth cones and neurites, intracellular signaling cascades are initiated, leading to changes in the growth cone morphology as well as the trajectory of growing fibers. The repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) was originally identified in the chick retinotectal system as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, membrane-bound protein with repulsive properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monnier et al., 2002</xref>). In vertebrates, three homologues of RGM, namely, RGMa, RGMb (DRG11-responsive axonal guidance and outgrowth of neurite), and RGMc (hemojuvelin) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niederkofler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidtmer and Engelkamp, 2004</xref>). RGMa, which is highly homologous (80% identity) to chick RGM, functions as a repulsive guidance cue in the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsunaga et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson and Key, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Metzger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tassew et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Neogenin, the receptor for RGMa, is a single membrane-spanning protein, a member of the Ig superfamily, and closely related to the netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan et al., 2004</xref>). Neogenin is broadly expressed in the embryonic and adult CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gad et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manitt et al., 2004</xref>). The molecular mechanisms of RGMa&#x02013;neogenin signaling have been identified. RGMa inhibits the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar granule neurons in a RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 2006</xref>). RGMa binding to neogenin activates RhoA, Rho kinase, and PKC, inducing growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>). However, the mechanism of the neogenin-mediated regulation of RhoA activity remains unknown. In this study, we show that Unc5B associates with leukemia-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF [LARG]) to mediate the signal transduction leading to growth cone collapse and RhoA activation.</p><p>Unc5B is a member of the netrin receptor Unc5 family, which includes Unc5A&#x02013;D, which is also called Unc5h1&#x02013;4. All members of the Unc5 family are single-pass transmembrane proteins. They have a highly conserved common structure. Two Ig and thrombospondin domains are located in the extracellular region. The zona occludens (ZO)-1 and Unc5-like netrin receptor (ZU5) domain, DCC-binding (DB) domain, and death domain (DD) are located in the intracellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelkamp, 2002</xref>). Unc5 is widely expressed in various embryonic and adult tissues in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelkamp, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manitt et al., 2004</xref>). The DCC&#x02013;Unc5 receptor complex initiated by netrin-1 induces long-range repulsion from netrin-1, whereas the Unc5 receptor alone transduces short-distance repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barallobre et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>LARG is a member of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)&#x02013;RhoGEF subfamily. A total of three RhoGEFs, namely p115RhoGEF, PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 homology)-RhoGEF/GTRAP48, and LARG, have been isolated in this subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuhara et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2000</xref>). All members of this subfamily contain both Dbl/pleckstrin homology and RGS domains, but only LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF contain the PDZ domain. Although p115-RhoGEF expression is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells, LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF are widely expressed in various organs and organ systems, including the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuhara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kourlas et al., 2000</xref>). LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF bind to the activated &#x003b1; subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) G&#x003b1;<sub>12</sub> and G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub> through the RGS domain, leading to the activation of RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuhara et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2001</xref>). The involvement of these RhoGEFs in RhoA activation mediated by the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor or semaphorin 4D/plexin-B1 receptor has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aurandt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Driessens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that Unc5B constitutively associates with neogenin as a coreceptor for RGMa. RhoA activation and growth cone collapse by RGMa were inhibited by dominant-negative Unc5B or siRNA against Unc5B. Next, Unc5B interacted with LARG to transduce the RGMa signal. Furthermore, we found that FAK was involved in RGMa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG as well as RhoA activation. Thus, Unc5B associates with neogenin to form a coreceptor for RGMa and interacts with LARG to mediate RhoA activation and growth cone collapse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Neogenin associates with Unc5B</title><p>We first examined whether neogenin interacted with Unc5B. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected with mock, vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G)&#x02013;tagged neogenin (neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G) and mock, HA-tagged Unc5B (Unc5B-HA) and mock, or neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G and Unc5B-HA constructs. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti&#x02013;VSV-G or anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Of all the neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G immunoprecipitates, the anti-HA antibody revealed the presence of Unc5B-HA only in the precipitates from neogenin&#x02013;Unc5B-cotransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Similar results were observed in the experiment in which the anti-HA antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation (IP) of Unc5B-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>).

To examine the in vitro binding between the neogenin and Unc5B extracellular domains (ECDs), ELISA was performed. We added 2 &#x000b5;g/ml Fc-tagged recombinant Unc5B ECD (Unc5B-ECD-Fc) or BSA to plastic wells coated with 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml His-tagged recombinant neogenin-ECD (neogenin-ECD-His) or BSA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>, left). The mean OD value when Unc5B-ECD-Fc was added to the well coated with neogenin-ECD-His was significantly higher than those of the controls, indicating that recombinant neogenin-ECD binds directly to recombinant Unc5B-ECD in vitro. We also investigated the interaction of RGMa with Unc5B-ECD-Fc by ELISA. As reported previously, specific RGMa-Unc5B binding was not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuns-Hashimoto et al., 2008</xref>). To determine whether the association between ECD of neogenin and Unc5B occurred in cis or trans, we conducted cell mixing experiments using neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G&#x02013; and Unc5B-HA&#x02013;transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, H and I</xref>). Cell lysates were prepared from the culture of 293T cells transfected with mock, neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G, or Unc5B-HA constructs and from a mixed culture of neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G&#x02013; and Unc5B-HA&#x02013;overexpressing cells. These lysates were subjected to co-IP analysis. We did not observe co-IP of neogenin with Unc5B in the mixed cell culture. Moreover, the specific interaction of neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G with Unc5B-ECD was detected in transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, J and K</xref>). These findings suggest that neogenin-ECD interacts with Unc5B-ECD in cis.</p><p>To investigate the in vitro binding between the neogenin and Unc5B intracellular domains (ICDs), a GST pull-down assay was performed. Extracts from 293T cells that expressed various HA-tagged deletion constructs of the Unc5B ICD shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 L</xref> were incubated with GST or GST-neogenin-ICD. Mutants containing the DB domain (Unc5B ICD-HA and Unc5B ZU5/DB-HA) bound to GST-neogenin-ICD, whereas those without the DB domain (Unc5B ICD-ZU5-HA and Unc5B DD-HA) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 M</xref>). These data suggested that Unc5B interacted with neogenin via its ECD and intracellular DB domain.</p><p>To characterize the interaction of endogenous neogenin and Unc5B in vivo, we examined the interaction by using lysates prepared from rat cortical neurons obtained on embryonic days (E) 19&#x02013;20. IP was performed with anti-Unc5B or control antibody followed by immunoblotting with antineogenin antibody. Neogenin was detected in the immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-Unc5B antibody but not in those obtained using control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 N</xref>). We also examined whether this interaction was regulated by RGMa bound to neogenin. The amount of neogenin detected in the immunocomplex with Unc5B did not change when the cells were stimulated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml RGMa for 15 min. We confirmed that the Unc5B antibody used in this assay did not detect the overexpressed neogenin in 293T cells, supporting the specific binding of neogenin to Unc5B in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 O</xref>). Thus, neogenin constitutively interacted with Unc5B in the cortical neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Unc5B mediates RGMa-induced RhoA activation</title><p>The interaction of neogenin and Unc5B prompted us to examine whether the latter was required for RGMa&#x02013;neogenin-mediated signaling. Because it has been reported that RGMa activates RhoA in primary neurons and that this activation is dependent on neogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), we explored the role of Unc5B in RhoA activation by RGMa. The activity of RhoA was determined by the affinity precipitation of GTP-RhoA, using the RhoA-binding domain of the effector protein rhotekin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ren and Schwartz, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We first used 293T cells, which endogenously express the RhoGEF responsible for RGMa-induced RhoA activation (LARG; see the following section) but express considerably lower levels of neogenin and Unc5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref> and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).

The RhoA activation assay was performed in the presence and absence of 2 &#x000b5;g/ml RGMa. Cells expressing the mock construct either alone or in combination with neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G or Unc5B-HA did not show a significant change in the RhoA activity in response to RGMa. In contrast, cotransfection with neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G and Unc5B-HA resulted in a significant increase in the RGMa-induced RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). In addition, cotransfection with neogenin&#x02013;VSV-G and Unc5B-ECD constructs did not lead to an increase in the RGMa-induced RhoA activity. These data showed that Unc5B, especially its ICD, was required for RGMa-induced RhoA activation in 293T cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Involvement of Unc5B in RhoA activation by RGMa.</bold> (A) Affinity precipitation of GTP-RhoA in the 293T cells transfected with mock, neogenin and mock, Unc5B and mock, neogenin and Unc5B, or neogenin and Unc5B-ECD constructs.

As our data demonstrate that Unc5B-ECD directly interacts with neogenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref>) and that the interaction of endogenous neogenin with Unc5B in cortical neurons is inhibited by the addition of Unc5B-ECD-His (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), Unc5B-ECD-His may function as a dominant-negative inhibitor of endogenously expressed Unc5B and block the RGMa signaling pathway. To test this possibility, rat cortical neurons (E19&#x02013;20) were cultured for 48 h with Unc5B-ECD-His, recombinant tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB)&#x02013;His, or control solution and treated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml RGMa or control medium; the activity of RhoA was then measured.

A total of 72 h after transfection with Unc5B-HA or mock construct into Unc5B knocked-down neurons, cells were treated with 2 &#x000b5;g/ml RGMa or control medium for 15 min and subjected to the RhoA activation assay. The transfection of Unc5B rescued RGMa-induced RhoA activation in Unc5B siRNA&#x02013;transfected neurons, whereas the transfection of the mock construct did not. Thus, our data support the notion that the effect of Unc5B siRNA on the RGMa-elicited RhoA activation was not an off-target effect. These results suggest that Unc5B, which interacts with neogenin, transduces the signal from RGMa to RhoA.</p><p>To confirm the previous study demonstrating the involvement of neogenin in RGMa-induced RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>), we examined the effects of knockdown of neogenin expression on the activation of RhoA by RGMa in cortical neurons.

Rho GTPases are activated by proteins that augment GTP binding such as GEFs. Promising candidate RhoGEFs that participate in the RGMa&#x02013;neogenin&#x02013;Unc5B pathway are the PDZ domain&#x02013;containing RhoGEFs, namely PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG. It was reported that both neogenin and DCC bind to FAK through their highly homologous ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ren et al., 2004</xref>) and that FAK phosphorylates PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chikumi et al., 2002a</xref>).

In addition, a member of the Unc5 receptor family, Unc5A, contains a PDZ-binding region in its C-terminal DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). These observations hinted at a connection between PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG and RGMa-induced RhoA activation.</p><p>We first investigated whether PDZ-RhoGEF or LARG interacted with neogenin or Unc5B by performing co-IP with transfected 293T cells. We did not observe the co-IP of neogenin with PDZ-RhoGEF, neogenin with LARG, and Unc5B with PDZ-RhoGEF (not depicted), whereas the co-IP of Unc5B with LARG was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). In the Unc5B-HA immunoprecipitates, myc-tagged LARG (myc-LARG) was detected. Conversely, in the myc-LARG immunoprecipitates, Unc5B-HA was detected. The interaction between these molecules in rat cortical neurons was also confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>). RGMa-dependent alteration of the interaction was not detected under the condition described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>.

Previous studies show that LARG interacts with plexin-B1 or IGF-1 receptor via its PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirotani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we predicted that the LARG PDZ domain was important for the binding to Unc5B. IP was performed using lysates of 293T cells transfected with the mock construct, Unc5B-HA plus myc-LARG (full-length LARG), or Unc5B-HA plus myc-LARG&#x00394;PDZ (mutant LARG lacking the PDZ domain; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The full-length LARG precipitated Unc5B, whereas the deletion of the PDZ domain abolished the precipitation. We also demonstrated the specific interaction of Unc5B with the PDZ domain of LARG (myc&#x02013;LARG PDZ) in transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). These findings support our hypothesis that the PDZ domain of LARG binds to Unc5B. To identify the domains in Unc5B responsible for this interaction, we investigated the interaction of Unc5B with the PDZ domain of LARG in a GST pull-down assay using various deletion constructs of Unc5B ICD, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>. Unc5B intracellular mutants containing the DD (Unc5B ICD-HA and Unc5B DD-HA) were found to specifically interact with GST&#x02013;LARG PDZ. In contrast, the mutants lacking DD (Unc5B ZU5-HA and Unc5B ZU5/DB-HA) were not bound to GST&#x02013;LARG PDZ, indicating that DD of Unc5B was required and sufficient for the interaction of Unc5B with LARG. Moreover, no association of neogenin-ICD with LARG PDZ was detected in the GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>).

However, similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aurandt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Driessens et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>), the association of Unc5B with LARG was constitutive. Thus, the mechanism of RGMa-induced activation of RhoA by LARG cannot be explained by alteration of association of Unc5B with LARG in the ligand-dependent manner. We attempted to obtain more insight into the mechanism of LARG-mediated RhoA activation. FAK has been shown to interact with neogenin as well as DCC and mediate netrin-1&#x02013;induced outgrowth of cortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ren et al., 2004</xref>). Netrin-1 binding to DCC induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Activation of RhoA by LARG and PDZ-RhoGEF is enhanced when they are tyrosine phosphorylated by FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chikumi et al., 2002a</xref>). Moreover, when the cells are treated with RGMa, FAK is dephosphorylated at Tyr-397 (our unpublished observations).

We observed time-dependent induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG after 2 &#x000b5;g/ml RGMa treatment in COS-7 cells and cortical neurons.

Neogenin was identified as the receptor for RGMa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan et al., 2004</xref>), and several intracellular signals, including RhoA/Rho kinase, PKC, and myosin IIA were found to be activated downstream of neogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hata et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kubo et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanism via which the binding of RGMa to neogenin activates the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway remained to be clarified. In this study, we showed that Unc5B interacted with neogenin and acted as a coreceptor for RGMa and associated with LARG to mediate RhoA activation and growth cone collapse. Furthermore, we revealed that FAK was involved in RGMa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG as well as RhoA activation.</p><sec><title>Coreceptor system as the signal transducer of RGMa</title><p>Neogenin is a member of the DCC receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vielmetter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keeling et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyerhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan et al., 2004</xref>). Our finding that neogenin associates with Unc5 is similar to the well-established observation that DCC complexes with Unc5 to form a receptor complex for netrin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast to the observations that netrin-1 stimulation is required for this complex formation and that netrin-1 is a ligand of both receptors, the association of neogenin and Unc5B is ligand independent, and RGMa directly interacts with neogenin but not with Unc5B. Therefore, neogenin acts as a binding partner of its ligand, RGMa, whereas Unc5B may function as a signal-transducing element by binding with LARG. As the association of these receptors is constitutive, it remains to be elucidated how the signal transduction of RGMa is initiated.</p><p>The selective knockdown of Unc5B suppressed RGMa-dependent RhoA activation and growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, J&#x02013;M</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C&#x02013;F</xref>). A cursory examination of this result seems to suggest that other Unc5 family members do not contribute to RGMa signal transduction. However, the ECD, intracellular DB domain, and intracellular DD of Unc5B, which are important for the binding to neogenin or LARG, are highly conserved in all the members of the Unc5 family (Unc5A&#x02013;D/Unc5h1&#x02013;4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelkamp, 2002</xref>). In fact, neogenin interacted with Unc5A and Unc5C in transfected 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, C&#x02013;F</xref>). Moreover, our preliminary data suggest the possibility that Unc5A mediates RGMa-induced RhoA activation (unpublished data). These findings indicate that other Unc5 family members may also interact with neogenin or LARG and transduce the signal from RGMa to RhoA. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 (J&#x02013;M)</xref> may indicate that the total expression level of Unc5 family members (i.e., Unc5A + Unc5B + Unc5C + Unc5D) is important for the signaling from RGMa to RhoA. Further studies are required for the evaluation of the role of other Unc5 family members in the RGMa signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of RhoGEFs in the signal transduction of RGMa</title><p>LARG contains the PDZ, RGS, Dbl homology, and pleckstrin homology domains and shows a high level of sequence homology to PDZ-RhoGEF.

Although these results suggest that PDZ-RhoGEF is also involved in RGMa signaling, the interaction of PDZ-RhoGEF with Unc5B or neogenin was not detected. In addition, the specific inhibition of LARG was sufficient to attenuate the effects mediated by RGMa in the cortical neurons as well as in 293T and COS-7 cells. The participation of PDZ-RhoGEF in RGMa signaling should be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulatory mechanism of FAK activity</title><p>We demonstrated that FAK mediated RGMa-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG as well as RhoA activation. Because it has been reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of LARG by FAK results in the enhancement of RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chikumi et al., 2002a</xref>), the RhoGEF activity of LARG may be stimulated when LARG was tyrosine phosphorylated by FAK. However, it remains to be determined how RGMa binding to the receptor complex regulates the FAK activity.</p><p>An interesting hypothesis is the involvement of GPCRs in RGMa signaling. FAK was proposed to be activated by the heterotrimeric G protein &#x003b1; subunits G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>, G&#x003b1;<sub>12</sub>, and G&#x003b1;<sub>13</sub>, thereby enhancing the activation of Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chikumi et al., 2002a</xref>). GPCRs may play a role in initiating RGMa signaling by activating FAK. In addition, FAK is dephosphorylated at Tyr-397 after cells are treated with RGMa (our unpublished observations). The tyrosine phosphatase responsible for FAK dephosphorylation, which is not yet identified, might regulate LARG phosphorylation by FAK as well as RhoA activation after the RGMa treatment. Elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of FAK in RGMa signaling is expected to provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanism of neural wiring.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>VSV-G&#x02013;tagged human neogenin in pcDNA 3.1, the myc-tagged Unc5A in pSecTag B, HA-tagged rat Unc5B in pcDNA3.1, and myc-tagged Unc5C in pSecTag B were provided by E.R.
