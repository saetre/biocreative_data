Transient disruption leads to abnormal stem cell divisions and permanent cortical malformation.</p></abstract><abstract><p>During embryogenesis, the neural stem cells (NSC) of the developing cerebral cortex are located in the ventricular zone (VZ) lining the cerebral ventricles. They exhibit apical and basal processes that contact the ventricular surface and the pial basement membrane, respectively. This unique architecture is important for VZ physical integrity and fate determination of NSC daughter cells. In addition, the shorter apical process is critical for interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), which enables VZ cell mitoses at the ventricular surface. Despite their importance, the mechanisms required for NSC adhesion to the ventricle are poorly understood. We have shown previously that one class of candidate adhesion molecules, laminins, are present in the ventricular region and that their integrin receptors are expressed by NSC. However, prior studies only demonstrate a role for their interaction in the attachment of the basal process to the overlying pial basement membrane. Here we use antibody-blocking and genetic experiments to reveal an additional and novel requirement for laminin/integrin interactions in apical process adhesion and NSC regulation. Transient abrogation of integrin binding and signalling using blocking antibodies to specifically target the ventricular region in utero results in abnormal INM and alterations in the orientation of NSC divisions. We found that these defects were also observed in laminin &#x003b1;2 deficient mice. More detailed analyses using a multidisciplinary approach to analyse stem cell behaviour by expression of fluorescent transgenes and multiphoton time-lapse imaging revealed that the transient embryonic disruption of laminin/integrin signalling at the VZ surface resulted in apical process detachment from the ventricular surface, dystrophic radial glia fibers, and substantial layering defects in the postnatal neocortex. Collectively, these data reveal novel roles for the laminin/integrin interaction in anchoring embryonic NSCs to the ventricular surface and maintaining the physical integrity of the neocortical niche, with even transient perturbations resulting in long-lasting cortical defects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The developing cerebral cortex contains bipolar neural stem cells that span the cortical layers between the inner ventricular surface and the outer pial surface of the embryonic brain. The nuclei of these cells remain near the ventricular cavity, a microenvironment or niche thought to provide vital signals. It is not known how this inner end of the bipolar stem cell is held in place, or what would happen if its attachment to the inner surface were lost. Genetic manipulation can be used to disrupt candidate molecules involved in this adhesion, but this will affect all adhesion points and complicate the results. We have therefore developed an approach to target the stem cell attachments specifically at the ventricular surface by placing blocking antibodies directly into the ventricles of mouse embryos and then expressing fluorescent markers in the stem cells to see the effects of losing this attachment in living tissue. We examined laminins and integrins, whose expression and properties make them excellent candidates. Blocking integrin signalling by antibody application caused the inner end of the stem cells to rapidly detach and then undergo aberrant cell division. We also showed that a transient block of integrins (for &#x0003c;2 hours) resulted in permanent malformations of the cortical layers and disrupted neuronal migration.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cues responsible for maintaining the physical and molecular architecture of the stem cell niche of the developing mammalian brain are not well known.

To test the potential role of laminin/integrin binding in VZ maintenance and proliferation, we circumvented this possible compensation by transiently disrupting &#x003b2;1 integrin/laminin binding specifically in the VZ using blocking antibodies injected into the ventricle of the embryonic mouse brain. We also developed a novel ex vivo multiphoton time lapse imaging method that enables the effect of targeting of the blocking antibody to the cortical niche to be seen in real time. Furthermore, we analyzed VZ cell morphology and proliferation in laminin &#x003b1;2 deficient embryos. Together, our data demonstrate a novel role for laminin/integrin binding in the regulation of NSC proliferation and adhesion within the embryonic VZ, as well as its requirement to maintain the architecture of the neocortical niche.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Specific Inactivation of &#x003b2;1 Integrin Function at the Ventricular Surface</title><p>While &#x003b2;1 integrin (accession number Swiss Prot P09055, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot</ext-link>) has previously been shown to be present in the VZ of the developing cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Lathia1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-GrausPorta1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Campos1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, we confirmed the expression levels in the neocortical wall on the embryonic days at which we performed the perturbation studies.

The high level of &#x003b2;1 integrin continues into the cortical subventricular zone (SVZ) as marked by the second layer of PH3&#x0002b; cells, and &#x003b2;1 integrin is also highly expressed at the pial surface and in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Importantly, there are particularly high levels of &#x003b2;1 integrin on the apical surface of the VZ and on radial glia apical fibers (as assessed by double labelling with RC2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g001">Figure 1E&#x02013;1J</xref>). Analysis of the subcellular localization of &#x003b2;1 integrin within the ventricular processes reveals that this receptor is mainly located immediately basal to the adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000176.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

To accomplish this, we delivered a blocking antibody (Ha2/5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Mendrick1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> into the cerebral ventricle in utero to specifically block &#x003b2;1 integrin function in cells bordering the ventricle. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we first assessed the in vivo dynamics of the antibody by injecting fluorescently conjugated Ha2/5 into the ventricles of E14 mice in utero. We observed widespread localization of the antibody within the VZ and SVZ after 6 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000176.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) and 24 h (unpublished data). The antibody penetration was confined to apical regions and did not reach the pial surface. To confirm in vivo that the antibody inhibited integrin signalling, we evaluated phospho-Akt 1 (p-Akt 1) levels in the cortex 30 min after injection. p-Akt-1 is known to be highly expressed in NSC and is a well-recognized downstream signalling molecule in the integrin pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Hynes1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Sinor1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mitosis in the VZ normally occurs on the ventricular surface, after which the NSC soma transitions to the abventricular side of the VZ before entering S-phase (which can be identified by the incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine &#x0005b;BrdU&#x0005d; into the newly synthesized DNA). This cell cycle-dependent nuclear movement is known as INM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, perturbation of &#x003b2;1 integrin signalling shifted the maximum labelling index 80&#x02013;110 &#x000b5;m away from the ventricular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, two-way ANOVA), and also resulted in an overall increase in the number of BrdU&#x0002b; cells. Thus in addition to the PH3&#x0002b; mitotic cell ectopias, supernumerary S-phase cells were found in abnormal positions following &#x003b2;1 integrin blockade. To investigate somal translocation towards the VZ surface (i.e., M-phase reentry), E15.5-injected embryos were pulsed with BrdU 6 h prior to sacrifice, allowing the majority of proliferative cells to transit through S-phase and be on the ventricular surface either in or approaching mitosis at the time of analysis. In the embryos injected with the ITC antibody, this nuclear movement was indeed observed with the highest labelling index occurring in bin 1 nearest the ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). While bin 1 also contained the highest labelling index in Ha2/5-injected brains, there was a significant increase in the labelling index of abventricular bins (bins 7&#x02013;20) compared to controls. Thus, although continued ventricular divisions were apparent following blockade of &#x003b2;1 signalling, the abventricular dividing progenitor population was significantly increased.</p><fig id="pbio-1000176-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000176.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Cell proliferation is disrupted in the embryonic telencephalon after intraventricular injection of a &#x003b2;1 integrin blocking antibody.</title><p>(A, B) Fluorescence micrographs of PH3 expression (green, dapi-counterstained nuclei in blue) after antibody injection at E12.5.

Previously, &#x003b2;1 integrin has been suggested to be important for neocortical formation through its regulation of the radial glial contacts on the pial basement membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-GrausPorta1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Belvindrah1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In our study, we combined in utero electroporation and injection of a specific blocking antibody to specifically inactivate the &#x003b2;1 integrin receptor by preventing binding to its ligand (laminin) at the ventricular surface. Compared to transgenesis or siRNA knock down, which cause widespread effects throughout both cell and tissue, this novel approach resulted in a focused and transient disruption at the subcellular level that resulted in detachment of the apical processes of many NSC from the ventricular surface and led to increased numbers of ectopic proliferating cells as well as perturbations to INM. Confirming that integrins act at least in part through interactions with laminins in the neocortical VZ, we found similar abnormalities in the laminin &#x003b1;2-deficient mouse. Together, our data clearly demonstrate for the first time in vivo, to our knowledge, that integrin/laminin interactions at the apical VZ surface play a critical role in the adhesion that maintains the stem cells within their niche and preserves the architecture of the VZ.</p><p>The adhesion of stem cells to their niche is critical for the molecular programmes that promote maintenance. For example, altered expression of adhesion-related genes is known to cause depletion of haematopoietic and epidermal stem cell niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Frye1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Wilson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent report has also shown that niche-supporting gonad cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also require integrin signalling to ensure niche integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Tanentzapf1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the VZ lacks a basal lamina, which is well recognized as a principal site of cell/extracellular matrix interactions, we have shown previously that both laminins (&#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;4, and &#x003b1;2 chains) and integrins are expressed at the apical surface of the neocortical wall in the embryonic mouse VZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Lathia1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present observations suggest that integrin/laminin interactions are necessary to enable the retention of apical processes seen for at least 5 h after mitosis, and which may be critical for key cell-cell interactions that instruct behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Miyata1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. So, while no perturbation of cell differentiation following &#x003b2;1 integrin blockade has been detected in our study, premature loss of these interactions resulting from apical process detachment has profound consequences on other aspects of NSC behaviour, including dysregulated proliferation of the NSC and altered allocation to the developing cortical plate. Interestingly a recent investigation of the role of &#x003b1;6&#x003b2;1 integrin in the adhesion of adult SVZ progenitor cells to endothelial cells using the same in vivo blocking antibody paradigm demonstrated two similar phenotypes to those we observed in the embryo&#x02014;separation of SVZ progenitor cells from their normal location (adjacent to blood vessels) and enhanced proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Shen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrin/laminin interactions may therefore play similar roles in the regulation of neural stem and progenitor behaviour in embryonic and adult central nervous system. Whether blood vessels in the embryonic NSC niche provide some of these laminins as they do in the adult remains unknown, but recent studies do suggest a critical role of the developing cortical vasculature in regulating cortical neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Javaherian1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Vasudevan1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref> and laminin &#x003b1;2 is expressed in blood vessels in the embryonic VZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Lathia1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus our present results extend the importance of this role by demonstrating that &#x003b2;1 integrin signalling is required for the regulation of NSC mitotic spindle dynamics for the cells that normally undergo oblique cleavages during neocortical neurogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Furthermore, our data suggest regional differences in that medial and caudal telencephalic progenitors are most sensitive to &#x003b2;1 integrin signalling. In keeping with this, it is interesting to note that human congenital muscular dystrophy caused by deficiency of the laminin &#x003b1;2 chain has been associated with significant abnormalities of cortical development in the occipital but not frontal regions of the telencephalon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Philpot1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pbio-1000176-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000176.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model depicting the role of &#x003b2;1 integrin in the VZ.</title><p>Schematic (left) showing the normal VZ with NSC attached at the ventricular surface undergoing mitosis in a variety of orientations.

We found that the NSC proliferation and morphological defects occurring after &#x003b2;1 integrin blockade had long-term consequences on the migration of both the newly formed neurons as well as those previously generated before the antibody injection. For example, the deep cortical layers (IV and V), which contain neurons born before the perturbation on E15.5, were also thinner than in controls. This deep layer defect is not likely to be caused solely by a disruption in neurogenesis at midgestation, since the earlier born neurons would be expected to establish proper laminar positions. Rather, it points to a phenotype resulting from the dystrophic radial glia processes we observed in the antibody-injected tissue, with cells born several days prior to the injection and still en route to the cortical plate affected by the morphological changes to the radial glia in the VZ. The most parsimonious explanation is that the loss of apical adhesion leads to NSC detachment and shortening and dystrophy of the basal process, and this in turn perturbs the migration of the cells on these processes. Supporting this proposed mechanism, several reports have demonstrated that mechanical forces play an important role in shaping the developing brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Miyata2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-Hayashi1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000176-VanEssen1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. The present data suggest that anchorage of the apical endfeet provides the physical tension required for maintenance of position and morphology of radial glia cells during corticogenesis. Thus, our data using short-term blocking approaches reveal functions not shown by knock-out experiments and clearly define the novel contribution of integrins to neocortical development by elucidating a number of key roles in the regulation of NSC behaviour in the mammalian VZ.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Control ICR mice were produced in the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) animal facility.

Nuclear counterstaining was performed by 10 min incubation at room temperature in TOPRO-3 iodide (1&#x02236;100, Molecular Probes).</p><p>For the subcellular localization analysis of &#x003b2;1 integrin, first a postfixation with methanol at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 10 min was performed on the cryosections before a blocking step in a solution containing bovine serum albumin 3&#x00025; and Tween 0.05&#x00025; for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Then, anti-&#x003b2;1-integrin antibody (clone MB1.2 from Chemicon Int., 1/100 dilution) and Alexa Fluor 546 coupled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 1/200 dilution) were incubated overnight in the blocking buffer at RT. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat antibody (Molecular probes, 1/250 dilution) was incubated for 1 h at RT along with Hoechst for nuclei staining. Images were captured with a Zeiss confocal using an oil immersion 63&#x000d7; objective with a zoom of 2. The profile function of the Zeiss acquisition software was used to determine the fluorescence intensity of each marker at a defined <italic>xy</italic> position.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Quantitative Analysis</title><p>For PH3 analysis performed 18 h following antibody (ITC or &#x003b2;1 blocking) injection at E12.5, positive cells were calculated from the average of three sections from five separate embryos from two litters. For E15.5 injected embryos, positive cells were calculated from the average of three sections from 11 (ITC) or 17 (&#x003b2;1 integrin blocking antibody) separate embryos from nine litters. For BrdU analysis, labelling index was calculated on the basis of three sections from three embryos from 1 litter for both E12.5 and E15.5 injected embryos. For Tbr2 expression analysis, a 200 &#x000b5;m&#x000d7;100 &#x000b5;m (width&#x000d7;height) region adjacent to the ventricular surface was analyzed and an average was calculated on the basis of three sections from three embryos from one litter. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). The specific statistical test is indicated in both the text and figure legends.</p><p>Apical process quantification was performed on 150-&#x000b5;m vibrating microtome-cut coronal sections of co-antibody injected/CAG-RFP electroporated E13.5 and E15.5 brains stained with phalloidin to label the ventricle surface. 80-&#x000b5;m z-stacks were collected in 2-&#x000b5;m steps with a 1,024&#x000d7;1,024 pixel frame size and each z-stack was analyzed with LSM examiner (Zeiss) and Volocity software (Improvision) to determine the number of RFP&#x0002b; cell bodies within 200 &#x000b5;m from the ventricle surface and to determine the number of apical processes attached to the ventricle (colocalized with the phalloidin staining). Both of these counts were calculated from the average of three embryos for each condition. The ratio soma/apical processes (S&#x02236;P) representing the total number of cell bodies divided by the number of apical processes was determined and the results were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test.</p><p>The postnatal phenotype of embryos co-injected/electroporated at E15.5 was assessed at P4 by determining the thickness of the individual cortical layers (I, II/III/IV, V, VI as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000176-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) and by the radial distribution (i.e., layer specification) of RFP&#x0002b; cells in multiple areas at both the primary motor and somato-sensory cortical levels. The data from two ITC and three &#x003b2;1 integrin blocking antibody injected animals were analysed by unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistical Modelling</title><p>In preparation of performing statistical analysis we checked assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, and found that the data for the orientation of cell division were not normally distributed and could not be transformed to achieve acceptable levels of normality to permit linear regression analysis. Thus, an ordinal logistic regression model was developed to estimate the tendency toward having greater angles of cleavage in one group (&#x003b2;1 integrin blocking antibody injected brains or Ln&#x003b1;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> brains) compared to another (controls: ITC injected brains or wild type littermates from Ln&#x003b1;2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos). To perform these analyses, angles of cleavage were stratified as, &#x0003c;30 degrees, 30 to &#x0003c;60 degrees, and 60&#x02013;90 degrees. The model, which included covariates to account for brain region and study group, enabled the study to estimate and compare differences in the frequency of angle of cleavage strata in one study group compared to another. The model adjusted variance estimates to account for the correlation between repeated measurements on the same embryo.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000176.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p><bold>&#x003b2;1 integrin is localized basally to adherens junctions.</bold> (A) Colabelling of &#x003b2;1 integrin and actin in E14 neocortical VZ reveals the basal localization of &#x003b2;1 integrin staining relative to actin-based adherens junctions.
