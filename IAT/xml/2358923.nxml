Recently, the absence of transcripts of the water channel, aquaporin-5 (AQP5), was demonstrated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) in KC tissues and was proposed as a possible marker for KC.

Corneal thinning in KC individuals induces irregular astigmatism, myopia, and central or paracentral conical protrusion. The calculated incidence of KC is between 1 in 500 and 1 in 2,000 individuals in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>] with the disease being the most common indication for penetrating keratoplasty in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Histopathological features of keratoconic corneas have been clearly defined and include stromal thinning, iron deposits in the epithelial basement membrane, and breaks in Bowman's layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. The etiology of KC is largely unknown, and genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role in distinct analyzed populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. Most cases of KC occur sporadically, but it has been estimated that up to 10% of cases has a positive familial history for the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. This observation along with the occurrence of the disorder in monozygotic twins and the bilateralism of the disease strongly suggest that genetic factors are important for KC development. In families with KC Mendelian transmission, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance has been established. In addition, genome-wide linkage analyses in familial cases have evidenced several chromosomal regions that harbor potential KC-causing genes including 5q14.3-q21.1, 16q22.3-q23.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>], 3p14-q13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>], and 2p24 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. However, a definitive KC-causing gene has not been identified to date. As the disease initiates typically during adolescence, the identification of a molecular marker associated to the development of the disease would be particularly helpful in the early identification of individuals at risk of developing KC.</p><p>The aquaporins (AQPs) constitute a large family of water channels that play a critical role in transcellular water movement in many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. The aquaporin-5 (<italic>AQP5</italic>) gene is normally expressed in corneal epithelial cells where it is presumably involved in fluid elimination as supported by the observation that <italic>Aqp5</italic> null mice exhibit abnormalities in both corneal thickness and corneal epithelial water permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Recently, the absent expression of <italic>AQP5</italic> from the corneal epithelium was shown to be a feature of KC corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. However, no additional studies have been performed to validate the possible involvement of <italic>AQP5</italic> in KC. To further investigate this issue, we analyzed the expression of this gene in KC and healthy corneal tissues using immunohistochemistry, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Corneal samples</title><p>Sixty-nine samples of corneal tissue were obtained; 39 samples were corneal buttons from patients with KC, 16 were samples of corneal epithelium of patients who underwent surface refractive surgery (Photorefractive Keratectomy or Epi-LASIK), 12 were sclerocorneal rims obtained from healthy donor subjects, and two buttons were from healthy corneas. In the keratoconus group, the mean age was 25 years (range 14&#x02013;48 years), 68% were male and 32% were female. All KC cases correspond to advanced or late-stage instances of the disease confirmed by clinical (central or paracentral leukomas, Vogt&#x02019;s striae, and severe corneal stromal thinning) and corneal topographic criteria. Patients gave the appropriate permissions for their corneas to be used for this research. All tissues were obtained within 24 h after surgery. Samples were rinsed with 0.15 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and divided into two pieces unless otherwise stated. One fragment of each sample was paraffin embedded whereas the other fragment was used for molecular analysis.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Electrophoretic analysis of conventional AQP5 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in keratoconus and non-keratoconus corneal tissue.

AQP5 plays an important role in corneal fluid elimination via the corneal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>], and <italic>Aqp5</italic> null mice have increased corneal thickness due to corneal swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. These data along with the finding of the absence of <italic>AQP5</italic> transcripts from KC corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] have led to a proposal that there is a potential role for AQP5 in the physiopathology of KC. In this study, we sought to compare the expression of AQP5 in KC and non-KC corneal tissues by means of several different techniques. Our results indicate that <italic>AQP5</italic> expression levels are similar in KC and non-KC corneas and that the immunolocalization of AQP5 did not differ between both groups when analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry. In our study, corneal epithelial tissues from non-KC subjects were compared to corneal buttons from KC. The difference in tissue samples (corneal epithelium versus corneal buttons) did not affect our conclusions as it has been demonstrated that AQP5 is exclusively expressed in corneal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>].</p><p>Controversial results have been reported regarding the involvement of AQP5 in KC. Kenney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>] found no significant differences in the staining pattern for AQP5 in epithelial cells of normal corneas and KC corneas. In contrast, another study reported the absence of <italic>AQP5</italic> transcripts from KC tissues when analyzing clones from a human KC cornea cDNA collection and by RT&#x02013;PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. This finding was interpreted as a possible feature of KC corneas. However, the comprehensive evaluation of both <italic>AQP5</italic> mRNA and protein in KC tissues that we describe in this work argue against a potential involvement of this aquaporin as a KC etiologic factor or as a late-stage marker of the disease. The discrepancy between our results and those previously published could be explained by specific genetic differences between ethnic groups, by the stage of KC development analyzed, which was moderate to advanced KC in the Rabinowitz et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] and exclusively advanced KC in our study, or by distinct etiopathologic factors among KC subjects from different populations.</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that an abnormality in AQP5 mRNA or protein is not likely involved in KC physiopathology. In addition, to determine the possibility of <italic>AQP5</italic> mutations occurring in DNA from KC patients, a nucleotidic sequence of the <italic>AQP5</italic> gene was performed in several individuals with the disease, but no mutations were identified [unpublished data]. This result is in agreement with those reported by Rabinowitz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>] who did not find <italic>AQP5</italic> mutations in DNA from KC corneas.</p><p>In our study, AQP5 staining by immunohistochemistry revealed a punctate rather than a membrane-associated epithelial pattern. This pattern is identical to that reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. An interesting find in this work was that AQP5 expression is preserved in KC corneal epithelial cells after 21 days of culture. This result suggests AQP5 could be used as a suitable marker for cultured corneal epithelial cells. In conclusion, we do not find evidence of AQP5 involvement in KC corneal tissue in this sample of Mexican patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Special thanks to Guadalupe Quintero for her technical assistance.
