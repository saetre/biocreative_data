The spinal mechanism of OT is, however, still unclear and requires further investigation.

This OT-specific stimulation of glutamatergic neurons allows the recruitment of all GABAergic interneurons in lamina II which produces a generalized elevation of local inhibition, a phenomenon which might explain the reduction of incoming A&#x003b4; and C primary afferent-mediated sensory messages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results obtained in lamina II of the spinal cord provide the first clear evidence of a specific local neuronal network that is activated by OT release to induce antinociception.

It is also synthesized in parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) which project to various areas of the central nervous system including the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, oxytocinergic projection sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] match well OT binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn and in the autonomic regions (intermediolateral columns, intermediomedial grey matter, lamina X and sacral parasympathetic nucleus). Using electron microscopy, OT-positive synaptic terminals were found to form mainly axodendritic synapses on lamina I-II neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although some conflicting results have been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], analgesic effects of OT have been reported in most studies after systemic and/or central administration of OT in naive rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] or during the development of inflammatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An OT-sensitive antinociception can also be induced in rats by massage-like stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], swim stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and electrical stimulation the PVN in na&#x000ef;ve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and neuropathic rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting the involvement of an endogenous OT receptor-dependent analgesic system.</p><p>Little is known about the possible mechanisms and neuronal networks mediating these antinociceptive effects of OT in the spinal cord. PVN stimulation or OT infusion reduced the incoming peripheral A&#x003b4; and C-fiber activation in dorsal horn spinal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It should be noted here that most of these in vivo results were obtained from neurons receiving convergent sensory informations (from A&#x003b2;, A&#x003b4; and C fibers) and recorded in deep layers (Lamina III-V) of the dorsal horn. In some rare cases, neurons were also shown to be excited after application of OT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or after PVN stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, in spinal cord slices of rats and mice, OT reduced electrically-evoked glutamatergic synaptic currents between primary afferents and lamina II neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] whereas in primary cultures of neonatal laminae I-III dorsal horn neurons, OT produced a facilitation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission via a presynaptic mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Finally, OT was shown to inhibit glutamate-induced excitation of spinal neurons in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and, in a recent study, antinociceptive action of spinal OT is proposed to be mediated by a GABAergic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In order to clarify the effects of OT in spinal antinociception, we determined its effects on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in lamina II, a layer containing mainly local interneurons which are thought to play an important role in spinal pain processing by controlling the local balance between excitation and inhibition. Using electrophysiological and morphological tools, we characterized the effects of OT on lamina II neurons, identified a subpopulation of OT-sensitive postsynaptic target neurons, specify their neurochemical identity and their role in recruiting a local interneuronal network leading to antinociception.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characterization of fast spontaneous synaptic transmission in lamina II interneurons</title><p>In all lamina II neurons recorded in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique (n = 39), spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and sEPSCs, respectively) were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Under our experimental conditions, the chloride equilibrium potential was set at -60 mV, and IPSCs were recorded as transient outward currents when lamina II neurons were held at 0 mV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Both glycine- and GABA<sub>A </sub>receptor-mediated sIPSCs (GABAA-R sIPSCs) were present and were blocked by 1 &#x003bc;M strychnine (not shown) and 10 &#x003bc;M bicuculline respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). We found that pharmacologically-isolated GABAA-R sIPSCs occurred at a mean frequency of 0.12 &#x000b1; 0.02 Hz and exhibited a mean amplitude of 11.1 &#x000b1; 1.5 pA (n = 6). For comparison, fast glutamatergic sEPSCs were detected as transient inward currents at a holding potential of -60 mV (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). They occurred at a mean frequency of 1.26 &#x000b1; 0.47 Hz and had a mean amplitude of -16.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 pA (n = 16). These currents were blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10 &#x003bc;M) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), indicating that they were mediated by the AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors.

Bath application of the selective oxytocin receptor agonist (TGOT 1 &#x003bc;M) increased the frequency of occurrence (but not the amplitude) of spontaneous AMPA-R sEPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, histogram) in 5 out of 14 lamina II neurons (35.7%). This frequency of sEPSCs was of 1.04 &#x000b1; 0.38 Hz under control conditions and increased to 1.79 &#x000b1; 0.55 Hz in the presence of TGOT (n = 5). This change was reversible and found to be statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and represented an average increase of 103 &#x000b1; 27%. By contrast to its relatively modest effect on sEPSCs, TGOT (1 &#x003bc;M) induced a significant increase in the amplitude (Control: 14.4 &#x000b1; 1.8 pA; TGOT: 25.5 &#x000b1; 2.6 pA, n = 6; p &#x0003c; 0.05) and frequency of GABAA-R sIPSCs (Control: 0.12 &#x000b1; 0.02 Hz; TGOT: 1.69 &#x000b1; 0.61 Hz, n = 6; p &#x0003c; 0.05) in all lamina II neurons from which we recorded (n = 6 out of 6). The effect of TGOT was fully reversible after 10&#x02013;15 minutes of washout and was never observed in the presence of OTA (d(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sup>5 </sup>- [Tyr(Me)<sup>2</sup>, Thr<sup>4</sup>-Tyr-NH<sub>2</sub><sup>9</sup>] ornithine vasotocin, 1 &#x003bc;M), a selective OT receptor antagonists (n = 5, not shown).

The mean frequency of mEPSCs increased from 1.27 &#x000b1; 0.30 Hz under control conditions to 2.31 &#x000b1; 0.65 Hz in the presence of TGOT (1 &#x003bc;M).

In sharp contrast with this result, TGOT failed to change the frequency of occurrence of GABAA-R mIPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, right histogram) since, in all lamina II neurons recorded, the mean frequency remained stable (Control: 0.13 &#x000b1; 0.03 Hz; TGOT: 0.12 &#x000b1; 0.04 Hz, n = 6; p &#x0003e; 0.05; average change: -1.2 &#x000b1; 9.1%, n = 6).

As illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;C</xref>, this "novel" population of miniature AMPA-R EPSCs had larger time to peak values (&#x003c4;<sub>R</sub>: +20.9 &#x000b1; 4.6%, n = 6, p &#x0003c; 0.01), slower deactivation time constants (&#x003c4;<sub>D</sub>: +52.7 &#x000b1; 7.9%; n = 6, p &#x0003c; 0.001) and smaller mean amplitudes (Amp.: -20.9 &#x000b1; 2.0%; n = 6, p &#x0003c; 0.001). The effect of TGOT became particularly clear when the distribution of the monoexponential decay time constants of AMPA-R mEPSCs was represented under the form of a binned histogram (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Under control conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, top histogram), the distribution of the decay time constants could be adjusted by a Gaussian distribution centered at 3.21 ms, while in the presence of TGOT this distribution was strongly asymmetric because of the presence of the "newly" detected mEPSCs with slow decay time constants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, bottom histogram). These TGOT-sensitive mEPSCs were fully blocked by CNQX (10 &#x003bc;M) and disappeared upon washout of TGOT.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Application of TGOT reveals a population of AMPA-R miniature EPSCs with slow activation and deactivation kinetics</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: The histograms show the distribution of the decay time constants (&#x003c4;<sub>D</sub>) of miniature AMPA-R EPSCs pooled from 6 cells and detected during an identical time period of 5 minutes before (top, n = 1075 events) and after the application of 1 &#x003bc;M TGOT (bottom, n = 1563 events).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, the c-Fos positive nuclei of PVN-activated cells in the spinal cord were rare and systematically localized in the most superficial layers of the dorsal horn (lamina I and outer part of lamina II: I/IIo) as well as in the sympathetic intermedio-lateral column (not shown). Lamina I/IIo cells immunopositive for c-Fos were mainly found in the ipsilateral dorsal horn, with a slight preference for the medial half of superficial laminae versus lateral half. This labeling matched the distribution of OT-positive fibers and OT-binding sites (see additional file 1). In good agreement, OT-containing fibers (brown staining in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, arrowheads) could be found close to the c-Fos positive nuclei (blue staining in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, arrows). PVN-activated cells were identified as neurons because c-Fos-positive nuclei were always surrounded by a thin (perinuclear) cytoplasmic compartment which was immunopositive for the neuronal marker MAP2 and negative for the astroglial marker GFAP (not shown). In a double immunofluorescence protocol against c-Fos and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme synthesizing GABA, c-Fos positive nuclei of PVN-activated cells were found in laminae with poor GAD-immunoreactivity (I/IIo) while lamina IIi showed a strong GAD-immunoreactivity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Among 720 c-Fos positive nuclei observed in lumbar segments of two animals (80% in lamina I, 20% in lamina IIo), none were found in GAD positive neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D&#x02013;F</xref>), thus suggesting that PVN-activated neurons represented a population of non-GABAergic, i.e. glutamatergic neurons. In addition, we performed patch-clamp recordings of lamina II neurons in the current clamp mode to characterize the effect of TGOT application on the membrane potential at rest (i.e. no current injection: i = 0). As illustrated in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> (top trace), TGOT superfusion (1 &#x003bc;M) did not modify the membrane potential (control: -63.6 &#x000b1; 1.7 mV; TGOT: -60.8 &#x000b1; 2.0 mV; n = 19; p &#x0003e; 0.05) in the vast majority of the recorded lamina II neurons (n = 19 neurons out of 21; 90.5%). Only a small fraction of neurons were depolarized transiently by TGOT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, bottom trace; n = 2 neurons out of 21; 9.5%), a result which was in good agreement with the small number of c-Fos positive lamina neurons II following PVN stimulation in vivo. It should be noted that although TGOT was able to increase the frequency of occurrence of sEPSPs (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials) in some recorded neurons, these events did not reach an amplitude or a frequency sufficient to trigger action potentials.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>c-Fos expressing cells in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn after electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral PVN</bold>. <bold>A: </bold>Labeled c-Fos positive nuclei were localized in the most superficial layers i.e. lamina I and outer lamina II (IIo). <bold>B</bold>: Double immunoperoxidase labeling with an antibody against NpOT showed NpOT positive fibers (brown; arrowheads on inset) in the vicinity of c-Fos expressing nuclei (blue grey; arrows on inset). <bold>C: </bold>Double immunofluorescence labeling with an antibody against glutamic acid-decarboxylase (GAD) showed c-Fos positive nuclei (red cy3 fluorescence) in lamina I and IIo exhibiting a low GAD-immunoreactivity (green FITC fluorescence) whereas lamina IIi was strongly labeled by GAD antibody. <bold>D, E, F</bold>: In double immunofluorescence, c-Fos positive nuclei (arrowheads) never exhibited GAD labeled cytoplasm, despite the proximity in lamina IIo of GAD-immunoreactive neurons (arrows).

This broad and massive facilitation of GABAergic inhibition is likely to represent the basis of the documented spinal antinociceptive effect of OT and of PVN stimulation. This effect might include a direct inhibition of superficial dorsal horn interneurons, projection neurons and a selective reduction in A&#x003b4;/C fiber-mediated excitation of spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. We also give strong arguments on the neurochemical nature of PVN-activated (OT-sensitive) neurons in the superficial layers of the spinal cord. These OT-activated neurons (seen as c-Fos positive) are mainly localized in lamina I-II and were never GAD positive. This is in good agreement with our electrophysiological result showing that OT excites a specific population of glutamatergic interneurons, tightly interconnected with all GABAergic interneurons in lamina II. This amplification mechanism increasing the level of spinal GABAergic inhibition is likely to explain most of the spinal OT antinociception seen in vivo.</p><sec><title>Presynaptic effect of OT on glutamatergic lamina II neurons</title><p>As a first approach, we compared the effect of OT on spontaneous and miniature EPSCs/IPSCs. Whereas miniature currents (i.e. recorded in the presence of TTX) reflect only the activity of individual release sites, spontaneous synaptic currents allow action potentials and network activity-driven neurotransmitter release. TGOT did not change the frequency of occurrence of GABA<sub>A</sub>-R-mediated miniature IPSCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) but significantly increased AMPA-R-mediated synaptic transmission in 50% of the recorded lamina II neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This suggested the presence of functional OT receptors on the presynaptic terminals of a subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons and the absence of such receptors on the synaptic endings of GABAergic dorsal horn interneurons. Although c-Fos expression was not observed in GAD positive neurons following PVN stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), we can not fully exclude that OT receptors are expressed by GABAergic interneurones. Should this be the case, we can however conclude that their activation is certainly not sufficient to directly increase the release probability of GABA (i.e. as seen in miniature transmission experiments; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) or to induce a significant action potential discharge in these neurons (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and related results in the text). These results are in agreement with those reported previously on cultured laminae I-III dorsal horn neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A major difference observed in slices compared to dorsal horn primary cultures concerned the recruitment by OT of a population of AMPA-R mEPSCs with slow rise and decay kinetics (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These mEPSCs were rare under control conditions (indicated by the histogram skewness in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) but were clearly seen after OT receptor stimulation. Their slow kinetics might indicate that they originate at synapses distant from the neuronal cell body, possibly on distal dendrites. In culture, dorsal horn neurons possess simpler dendritic trees and synapses normally impinging on distal dendrites might be established on the cell body and/or proximal dendrites. The existence of silent synapses due to the absence of functional postsynaptic AMPA-R has been previously shown in the spinal cord, in normal and pathological situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our results indicate for the first time that a pool of "presynaptically silent" synapses, which can be recruited or turned on functionally by a neuromodulator such as OT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), might exist in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Although we cannot completely exclude a postsynaptic locus for the expression of this phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the fast onset and reversibility TGOT effect on glutamatergic transmission argue rather in favor of the unmasking (i.e. by increasing the release probability) of presynaptically silent or whispering synapses at distal dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>A subpopulation of OT-sensitive glutamatergic neurons recruits GABAergic interneurons in lamina II</title><p>In contrast with the effect on miniature IPSCs, OT receptor activation induced a massive and generalized increase in spontaneous GABAergic transmission, since it was observed in all lamina II neurons from which we recorded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This result is a key finding our study because it allows us to postulate that OT sensitive neurons, which are unlikely to be GABAergic (i.e. no effect of OT on the frequency of GABAA mIPSCs), are functionally connected (directly or indirectly) to all GABAergic interneurons in lamina II and are responsible for the facilitation of GABA release. Under the same conditions, however, the increase in spontaneous AMPA-R-mediated EPSCs concerned only a subpopulation of neurons (37%) comparable to that in which OT-receptor activation increased the frequency of mEPSCs. Our double immunofluorescence analysis indicates that c-Fos expressing neurons after PVN stimulation did not contain GAD, suggesting that the c-Fos positive neurons were likely to be glutamatergic. An interesting finding of the recent literature is the existence of a class of interneurons displaying no action potential discharge under resting conditions and receiving no apparent input from peripheral sensory fibers even when the latter were stimulated at C fiber strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These neurons are excited by PVN stimulation and the time-course of their excitation matched that of PVN-induced inhibition of A&#x003b4;/C afferent evoked electrical response. As indicated by the results from our current clamp experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), the neurons directly depolarized by TGOT, represent a very small population of lamina II neurons and this finding is in good agreement with the c-Fos labeling seen in this lamina after PVN stimulation. This result strongly supports the existence of an organized local spinal circuit mediating the inhibitory effects of the descending hypothalamic pathway at the spinal level. Immunohistochemical experiments based on the revelation of c-Fos positive nuclei following PVN stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) were in line with our electrophysiological results. Only a small number of neurons was labeled after PVN stimulation and these neurons were located in lamina I and in the outer part of lamina II. It is interesting to note that this area is the main target in the dorsal horn for OT-positive hypothalamo-spinal fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recent work on rat or OT-knock-out mice spinal cord has shown that OT reduced glutamatergic monosynaptic EPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation of primary afferents in the superficial layers of neonatal spinal cord slices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These results are not contradictory to our data since, as discussed in the work of Robinson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the presynaptic effect on primary afferent transmission might have been due to the activation of GABAergic neurons exerting an inhibitory effect on synaptic glutamate release from primary afferents.</p><p>Taken together, our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the spinal excitation resulting from peripheral C and A&#x003b4; sensory neurons is reduced by a local network involving a subpopulation of glutamatergic neuron activated by OT which excites GABAergic interneurons in lamina II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This synaptic organization might also explain earlier observations made in vivo and showing that application of OT induced either excitation or inhibition of dorsal horn neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Simplified diagram proposal summarizing the OT effects seen in lamina I-II at the light of our present study</bold>. Our results indicate that OT, which is physiologically released by hypothalamospinal fibers terminating in lamina I-II, activates a subpopulation of glutamatergic neurons (a) and, in particular, stimulates receptors present on presynaptic glutamatergic synaptic terminals (b). We also show that population of OT-sensitive glutamatergic neurons recruits the whole population of GABAergic neurons (c) resulting in an elevated GABAergic inhibitory tone in lamina II (represented as a green box). The dissection of the spinal action of OT can now unify previous observations which were in apparent contradiction. First, a network driven increase in GABAergic inhibition is likely to explain the specific inhibition of action potential triggered by the nociceptive activation of C and A&#x003b4; fibers [21,24]. In this case, a direct presynaptic inhibition of these fibers may be responsible for this effect (d). Alternatively, it remains possible that a specific C/A&#x003b4; network is inhibited through presynaptic fibre of neuronal inhibition (d). It remains that neurons, receiving convergent sensory inputs are not the direct target for OT effect since only C/A&#x003b4; fibre activity is reduced (e). Second, our findings and mechanism proposal fully answer to the questions left open after the work of Robinson et al [18], i.e. the presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release after stimulation of the dorsal roots and the postsynaptic effect on Lamina I-II neurons (OT sensitive neurons).

This network involves a subpopulation of OT receptor-expressing glutamatergic neurons that distribute their excitation to all GABAergic neurons in lamina II in order to limit or block nociceptive afferent messages originating from C and A&#x003b4; primary afferents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These PVN- and OT-activated lamina II interneurons certainly represent an interesting target for the development of specific therapeutic strategies to reduce nociceptive sensory messages at the spinal level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the International Association for the Study of Pain and directives set by the European Community Council Directive (86/69/EEC of November 24, 1986) and authorization from the French Department of Agriculture (License no. 67&#x02013;116 to PP).</p><sec><title>Spinal cord slice preparation</title><p>In this study we used 15- to 30-day-old Wistar rats anesthetized with a single i.p injection of ketamine (150 mg/kg).

Lamina II neurons were recorded blindly using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique and systematically dialyzed with biocytin in order to localize and determine the morphological characteristics of the recorded interneurons. Synaptic currents were recorded under voltage-clamp using an Axopatch 200B amplifier. The patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM): 80 Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 8 CsCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 Biocytin, and adjusted to pH 7.3 with CsOH. In voltage-clamp mode, lamina II neurons were held at potentials of -60 mV and 0 mV to record glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic currents, respectively. In a subset of experiments, we have used the current clamp mode to measure changes in the membrane potential (Em). Em was initially adjusted at -60 mV (i.e. with a small current injection if necessary), a value often corresponding to the resting membrane potential in our condition (no current injection: i = 0). For these experiments, cesium was replaced by potassium in the pipette solution described above. Synaptic currents were detected and analyzed individually using the WinEDR and WinWCP softwares (courtesy Dr J.
