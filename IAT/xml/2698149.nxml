There is no reliable and agreed method for measuring food intake of flies in undisturbed, steady state, and normal culture conditions. We report such a method, based on measurement of feeding frequency by proboscis-extension, validated by short-term measurements of food dye intake. We used the method to demonstrate that (a) female flies feed more frequently than males, (b) flies feed more often when housed in larger groups and (c) fly feeding varies at different times of the day. We also show that alterations in food intake are not induced by dietary restriction or by a null mutation of the fly insulin receptor substrate <italic>chico</italic>. In contrast, mutation of <italic>takeout</italic> increases food intake by increasing feeding frequency while mutation of <italic>ovo<sup>D</sup></italic> increases food intake by increasing the volume of food consumed per proboscis-extension. This approach provides a practical and reliable method for quantification of food intake in <italic>Drosophila</italic> under normal, undisturbed culture conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a key model organism for discovery of evolutionarily conserved biological mechanisms, which include the control of nutrient sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Gao1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Tapon1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Ueno1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Ishimoto1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and ageing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Giannakou1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Bass1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Reliable methods for measuring food intake of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are therefore often needed. However, quantification of food consumption in the fly poses challenges. In mammals, food ingestion can be directly quantified by weighing the food before and after feeding has taken place. However, flies consume volumes of food that are too low to weigh accurately, and feed by extension of their proboscis into the food medium, prohibiting direct observation of the volume of food ingested. One method has overcome this problem by measuring the food consumed in liquid form in a <underline>ca</underline>pillary <underline>fe</underline>eder (CAFE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Ja1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, despite being effective for quantifying intake, CAFE feeding substantially reduces both the egg-laying and lifespan compared to those seen in flies provided with food in the usual agar-gelled medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Bass1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Lee1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. This may be because in nature <italic>Drosophila</italic> feed on microorganisms, particularly yeast, on the surface of fruit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Kimura1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Carson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and thus feeding on a liquid diet from a capillary may not reflect their natural feeding environment.</p><p>To overcome the problems of measuring food intake when flies feed on gelled media, several studies have made indirect measures of food uptake after marking the food, either with a visible dye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Edgecomb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Min1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> or with radioactively-labelled nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-King1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, such &#x02018;tracer&#x02019; methods have limitations and can even give misleading results. Transferring flies to labelled food creates a disturbance that could change the volume of food ingested per proboscis-extension (ingestion ratio) and/or the frequency of proboscis-extension (feeding frequency), and therefore measurements immediately after transfer may not be an accurate reflection of food consumed during undisturbed conditions. Furthermore, because tracer methods rely on measuring only the volume of label present in the fly, the results can be influenced by factors other than feeding, and substantial differences in either the ingestion ratio or feeding frequency can be over-looked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, if the internal capacity of the flies for the label is increased by the experimental treatment, with no alteration in feeding, then with increasing times of exposure to the labelled food, the group with the higher internal capacity will give the spurious appearance of having a higher food intake. This problem can occur with dietary restriction in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which increases the capacity of the crop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, if flies differ in food intake but not in internal capacity for the food tracer, then once steady state is reached with rate of egestion of the label equalling the rate of intake, the amount of label present in the two groups of flies will be the same, despite their difference in food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. For the amount of label in the fly to reflect feeding, measurements must therefore be confined to the time period before label egestion commences, about 40 minutes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a time period during which disturbance of the flies affects their feeding behaviour. There is thus a requirement for a method of measuring feeding in undisturbed conditions.</p><p>Previously, we have reported that direct observations of fly proboscis-extension onto the food surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> can indicate food intake. This assay offers three advantages over the methods mentioned above: 1) repeated assays can be performed with the same flies through time because no flies are sacrificed for measurements, particularly valuable in the context of work on ageing; 2) the observations can be made on flies housed on standard laboratory food, and could be extended to other culture conditions; 3) food intake can be measured during undisturbed conditions once the proboscis-extension observations are calibrated by measures of short-term dye-accumulation, to determine the volume of food ingested per proboscis-extension.</p><p>In this study we tested the accuracy of the method, by measuring the volume of food ingested using a dye food label in parallel with observing the number of proboscis-extensions. We compared flies that had either known or suspected differences in food intake, such as males versus females, flies subjected to dietary restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Weindruch1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>chico</italic><sup>1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Clancy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>takeout</italic><sup>1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Meunier1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Barnes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> mutant flies relative to their controls. Additionally, we also checked that the ingestion ratio did not alter with age, by performing the combined assay on flies over various days of a lifespan.</p><p>Dietary restriction (DR) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is often achieved by dilution of the food medium, and complete records of food intake are needed to determine if flies compensate for the reduced nutritional content of food by increasing the total amount of food they consume. Measurement of food intake is also needed to determine if other interventions, such as sensory perception of food <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Libert1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, or reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling (IIS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Giannakou1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Broughton1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> extend lifespan by reducing nutritional intake and hence act by inducing a state of DR. We tested this possibility by measuring the food intake of flies carrying a mutant for the IIS gene <italic>chico</italic>, which extends the lifespan of <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Clancy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Establishing a relationship between proboscis-extension and total volume of food eaten</title><p>In nature and in the laboratory, fruit flies feed on the food surface, by extending their proboscis into contact with the food and drawing it in. The amount of proboscis-extension onto the food surface was measured by making periodic observations of groups of flies. The number of observations of proboscis-extension was then expressed as a proportion of the total number of observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Short-term food consumption was quantified by transferring flies onto food labelled with a non-toxic, non-absorbed blue dye. The amount of blue food present in the fly was quantified using spectrophotometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Edgecomb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The assay period was confined to the 30 minutes after transfer, because the dye is egested shortly after this length of time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus a 30-minute exposure period to blue dyed food ensured that all dyed food eaten during the assay is retained in the fly gut and none was lost by egestion.</p><p>To compare proboscis-extension measurement against dye ingested, we performed the two assays described above on the same cohort of flies. Initially, groups of 5, 7-day-old mated female flies were allowed to feed for 30 minutes on food labelled with blue dye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Edgecomb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> while we simultaneously observed the proportion of time they spent with the proboscis extended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Flies were then sampled, and the amount of blue food they ingested quantified. We then plotted the level of blue food measured in the group against the proportion of proboscis-extensions observed in that group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006063-g001"><bold>Figure 1a</bold></xref>). We found a strong positive linear relationship between the <underline>V</underline>olume of blue food found in the fly and the proportion of feeding events <underline>O</underline>bserved (V/O) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, linear mixed effect model, LMEM). The gradient of this relationship represents the ingestion ratio of the flies, as it describes the volume of blue accumulated per proboscis-extension. To test for non-linearity (for example, saturation or acceleration in the V/O relationship), we added a quadratic term to the statistical model. The quadratic term was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.62), indicating the V/O relationship is indeed linear over the timespan we measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006063-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).

The ingestion ratio was constant in males and in females, as both were found to have a significant V/O relationship (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, LMEM). The gradients of these relationships were not found to be significantly different (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9871), indicating that the ingestion ratio did not differ between the sexes. However, the intercept of the male relationship was significantly lower than that for females (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and suggested males across all observations contained a lowered basal level of blue dye content than in females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006063-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). This could be due to differences in body size and/or body composition (e.g., proportions fat, muscles and reproductive tissues). As in the previous analysis, the quadratic term was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.54), indicating that a linear V/O relationship exists. In spite of the sexes sharing the same ingestion ratio, females were found to have fed more than males over the 30-minute period because they spent a greater proportion of time with the proboscis extended (2.8-fold more on average) than males (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, generalised linear model, GLM). This suggested it is possible for flies to increase their food intake by feeding at a greater frequency rather than by consuming in greater volume, and it is possible to detect such differences in food intake.</p><p>We then extended the use of this method to examine the effect of other factors that could determine the physiology and behaviour of feeding flies. The nutritional environment may be such a factor, and is particularly important in the context of DR experiments where dietary dilution is employed to restrict access to nutrients. We therefore performed the combined assay with 7-day-old mated females that were fed either DR or full fed control diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Bass1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006063-g001"><bold>Figure 1c</bold></xref>). Flies on differing yeast concentrations did not alter the ingestion ratio, because no significant difference in V/O relationship was found (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, linear regression model), with no significant differences in the gradient and intercept of this relationship between the two different diet regimes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.447, respectively, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.304: <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006063-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Flies on the DR diet were also found not to compensate for the reduced nutrient availability by feeding more often, because the proportion of proboscis-extensions between DR fed and full fed flies during the 30-minute period of the combined assay were not different either (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.3693, GLM).</p><p>Finally, we also tested whether the ingestion ratio or feeding frequency were altered by genetic mutations known or suspected to affect feeding. The first mutation, <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic>, is a null mutation in the single fly insulin receptor substrate in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signalling (IIS) pathway, a pathway suggested to affect foraging and feeding in larvae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wu1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

This suggested that the ingestion ratios in both <italic>takeout<sup>1</sup></italic> flies and controls were similar. However, <italic>takeout<sup>1</sup></italic> flies fed more than controls, because they spent 1.6-fold more time with their proboscis extended on the food than did Canton-S flies (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, GLM). The flies thus elevated their nutrient-intake by feeding at a greater frequency, rather than by increasing the volume of intake per proboscis-extension.</p><p>The final mutant studied, <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup>, causes female sterility and has been reported to induce a reduced feeding frequency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Barnes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

A significant V/O relationship was found for both cohorts (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, LMEM); however, the gradient and the intercept for the relationship differed between the two genotypes (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 and <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, respectively). The V/O gradient for <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> was steeper (205.52 versus 14.46 in <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup>) and the intercept greater (56.40 versus 28.65 in <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup>) than for <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup> controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0006063-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> females thus had ingested a greater volume of food per proboscis-extension compared to <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup> controls (accumulated blue dye faster with each proboscis-extension), as well as a greater basal level of blue dye. However, no significant difference in the proportion of time spent feeding between <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> females and <italic>white</italic><sup>Dahomey</sup> controls was recorded (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.6289, GLM).

The food intake of the flies thus varied widely.

The variation in observed food intake is a possible indicator that transferring flies to labelled food may temporarily disturb their feeding behaviour and highlights the importance of measuring feeding during undisturbed conditions if a quantitative measure of normal intake is required.

Both the time of day and the group size had highly significant effects on the proportion of time spent feeding (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for both group size and time of day, GLM), while the interaction between these two was not significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.88). The lowest feeding proportion was observed in the morning for flies housed singly (0.15 of the time spent feeding), and this increased to approximately 0.50 in the afternoon and evening for flies feeding in groups of 5 or more. Both the afternoon and evening feeding proportions were significantly higher than those in the morning (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001 in both cases, GLM). There was no significant difference in feeding proportions between flies during the afternoon and evening (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.182, by model simplification).

We found that increasing the number of flies per vial increased the feeding frequency of each fly, and overall, flies fed more frequently in the afternoon and evening. We calculated the proportion of time spent feeding by summing the scored feeding events divided by the total number of feeding opportunities, which is unaffected by the difference in the number of vials per condition (b) The proportion of time spent feeding for flies fed different yeast-based diets.

As far as we are aware, no publication to date has studied either the feeding frequency of a cohort of flies throughout their lifespan or measured how much food flies consume throughout their lives. This is especially important when monitoring the effects of dietary restriction on lifespan, as the short-term probability of death as revealed by mortality analysis is rapidly affected by changes in nutritional conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite considerable variation in feeding between replicate groups of flies and between experiments performed on different days, the volume of food ingested per proboscis-extension (ingestion ratio) did not significantly differ between females and males, flies of different ages, flies subjected to DR and flies with mutations in <italic>chico</italic> or <italic>takeout</italic>. Only <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> females ingested more dye per proboscis-extension.</p><p>The observation data revealed that males feed less than females. The higher food intake of female flies is presumably related to their high nutrient-usage in egg-production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Lints1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The difference in intercept between the two sexes in the combined measurement indicates that amounts of blue dye are always lower in males, although the increase in blue food per proboscis-extension is the same. These lower basal levels of dye may be due to the differences in size (the total volume of the crop and gut), or because the differences in body composition (e.g. fat tissue, vitellogenic material or muscles) may affect the spectrometer reading.</p><p>Sterile <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> females exhibited a greater ingestion ratio than any of the other genotypes tested. This finding is surprising, because egg development is arrested in <italic>ovo<sup>D1</sup></italic> flies before the major nutrient investment occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Oliver1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. If the larger volume of food ingested reflects greater nutrient absorption and utilization in <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> flies, it could be that they expend more energy through a higher level of activity than fertile flies. This could partially explain why we found a higher ingestion ratio in these mutant flies. <italic>ovo</italic><sup>D1</sup> has been reported as feeding less frequently during long-term undisturbed conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Barnes1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, however, our results may not contradict those of Barnes <italic>et al.</italic> (2008), because our data were obtained from the first 30 minutes after transferring to blue-labelled food, and we found no differences with feeding frequency, only with ingestion ratio.</p><p>The combined assay is not suitable for long-term, undisturbed feeding experiments because the assay requires that flies are transferred to dyed food, which disturbs fly feeding behaviour. Frequencies of proboscis-extension were observed to be lower than in steady-state conditions, and only reached a constant level by the end of the 30-minute observation period. However, the indirect method alone is accurate for measuring fly feeding during long-term, undisturbed, experimental conditions once assessed by the combined assay for any differences in the ingestion ratio.</p><p>Data from the undisturbed steady-state studies suggested that flies exhibit marked diurnal differences in feeding behavior when feeding in groups and earlier in life. The effect of fly group size may reflect the role of aggregation pheromones, which act as communication signals between flies on breeding substrates, with feeding and oviposition rates increasing with the level of aggregation pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wertheim1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mutations in the IIS pathway have been shown to extend the healthy lifespan of the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, as well as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Giannakou1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Partridge1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Liang1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, there is intense interest in understanding how the effects of this pathway on healthy lifespan are mediated. A possible cause for the lifespan-extension effect in flies is that they reduce their food intake, resulting in self-imposed DR. If true, this could also account for the observed overlap between the effects of altered IIS and DR in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Partridge2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

We assessed the ingestion ratio and the undisturbed, long term feeding frequency of long-lived c<italic>hico</italic>-heterozygotes using the proboscis-extension assay and found total food intake was not reduced in the mutants. The increased survival of <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant flies compared to controls can therefore not be explained by a reduction in food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Clancy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the observed extension in lifespan in <italic>chico<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Clancy1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> is not simply due to self-imposed DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>DR in flies can be imposed by dilution of their food source, which is available in excess. Flies could therefore adjust their feeding frequency to compensate for the reduction in nutritional value, thus reducing or eliminating the effect of food dilution on nutrient-intake. The literature on this topic is conflicting, with some reports that flies can partially compensate for the food dilution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, others that they do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and others that even report increased food intake with increased nutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Min1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although each of these studies examined the effects of DR, none of them employ the same dietary conditions as each other. We therefore tested whether the yeast component of the diet could alter the feeding response to nutrient dilution, by comparing the effects on feeding frequency of DR using SYBrewer's yeast diet with that of a diet used in another published study, CSYExtract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to the data reported by Carvalho <italic>et al.</italic> (2005), we saw feeding frequency decrease as the concentration of CSYExtract in the medium was increased. In contrast, but consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, flies feeding on the SYBrewer's diet under DR and full fed conditions did not change their feeding frequency. These data demonstrate that different DR recipes can elicit different behavioural responses. This is interesting because it may also mean that different diets affect lifespan-extension in different ways. The flies on SYBrewer's diet fed at the same frequency as flies subjected to DR conditions using CSYExtract, which suggests that flies on the full fed CSYExtract diet decrease their feeding to avoid higher concentrations of food. This is consistent with yeast extract having a toxic effect on flies and shortening lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Bass1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An important element of studies into ageing is the longitudinal effects of lifespan-altering interventions. Previously, we have reported that flies subjected to DR do not alter their feeding frequency on day 7 of adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Wong1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It is still possible, however, that they do so later in life (day 40 onwards). We therefore conducted a longitudinal study of feeding frequency under DR. Very early in adult life (day 3) DR flies exhibited a higher feeding frequency than those under full fed conditions, but this did not occur over the majority of life and there were even individual instances of higher feeding frequency in full fed flies (later in life) than those subject to DR. This agrees with our previous longitudinal data on feeding frequency under DR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Mair1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This demonstrates that reduced nutrient intake does indeed correlate with extended lifespan for flies. Our data also show that the level of food consumption in older flies is remarkably lower in comparison to feeding levels in early-life (up to day 14), and more experiments will be required to understand how this lowered nutritional intake may contribute to declining mortality rates observed in late-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Curtsinger1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In recent years, various methods have been proposed to measure food intake in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Ja1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Edgecomb1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006063-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Flies were maintained in a pooled population, 100 flies per bottle, and a subset was collected and returned before and after the assay. Different measurements on different days were therefore considered to be independent of each other. Vials were coded and placed in a randomised order in rows on viewing racks at 25&#x000b0;C overnight. The assay occurred with minimal noise and physical disturbance to the flies. To avoid recording disturbed fly feeding behaviour, 30 minutes was allowed between the arrival of the observer and commencement of the assay. Observations were performed &#x0201c;blind&#x0201d; the next day for 90 minutes, commencing one hour after lights-on. In turn, each vial was observed for approximately 3 seconds during which the number of flies feeding was noted. A feeding event was scored when a fly had its proboscis extended and touching the food surface while performing a bobbing motion. Once all vials in the experiment had been scored in this way, successive rounds of observations were carried out in the same way for the whole 90 minutes of the assay, which, depending on the size of the experiment meant that each vial was observed once every 2 to 5 minutes.

To test for non-linearity, a quadratic term of observed feeding events was added to some models.
