They are transmitted from plant to plant by phloem-feeding homopterous insects, mainly leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), planthoppers (Fulgoroidea) and psyllids (Psyllidae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Phytoplasmas were recently assigned to the novel provisional genus <italic>Candidatus </italic>Phytoplasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They represent a monophyletic group within the class <italic>Mollicutes </italic>(trivial name mycoplasmas), which has evolved from Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Mycoplasmas are among the smallest self-replicating organisms known, and are characterized by a small genome with a low G+C content, and a lack of a firm cell wall. The genome sizes of phytoplasmas are estimated to range from 0.53 to 1.35 Mb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] with a GC content between 24 to 33 mol% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Phytoplasmas have two rRNA operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], while most other mycoplasmas have only one. Also, in contrast to most other mycoplasmas, phytoplasmas have resisted all attempts of cultivation in cell-free media, indicating that they have a different metabolism than other mycoplasmas and/or a greater reliance on their hosts. As a consequence, these pathogens are poorly characterized on a physiological and biochemical basis.</p><p>Molecular phytoplasma research is hindered by difficulties in obtaining high quality DNA from infected plants, and the instability of AT-rich DNA in large-insert genomic libraries. For these reasons, genomes of only four phytoplasma strains have been completely sequenced to date. These phytoplasmas include strains OY-M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and AY-WB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] of '<italic>Candidatus </italic>Phytoplasma asteris' (aster yellows [AY] phytoplasmas) and an Australian and a New Zealand strain of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. australiense' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' and '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. australiense' are closely related and positioned in the same major branch of the phytoplasma clade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In addition, large proportions of the accessible chromosome sequences of the two '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' strains are syntenic and show high overall DNA homology. All four sequenced phytoplasma chromosomes are circular, like those of all cultivable mycoplasmas examined thus far.</p><p>'<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' is the causative agent of apple proliferation (AP), one of the most economically important phytoplasma diseases in Europe, severely impairing fruit quality and productivity of the trees. Along with '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. pyri' and '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. prunorum', the causative agents of pear decline and European stone fruit yellows, respectively, and a few other phytoplasmas, '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' forms a second distinct major subclade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In previous work, physical mapping suggested that the chromosomes of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' strain AT and of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. prunorum' strain are circular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, in this paper we show that both the two phytoplasmas have linear chromosomes. A similar story has been traced for <italic>Streptomyces </italic>spp., where a circular genetic map was initially constructed until linearity of the chromosomes was finally confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Linear chromosomes are rare in bacteria and have only been identified in <italic>Streptomyces </italic>spp., other actinomycetes, the genera <italic>Borrelia </italic>and <italic>Coxiella </italic>and a biovar of <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here we report that not only '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' and '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. prunorum' have a linear chromosome, but also '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. pyri'. In addition, the structural and metabolic characteristics and other features of the completely sequenced chromosome of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' are described. Comparison of these data with those of the two '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' strains, from which genome sequences are available, reveal major differences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chromosome linearity</title><p>Restriction mapping indicated the presence of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) as known from linear chromosomes of <italic>Streptomyces </italic>species (see below). To prove linearity of the chromosome PFGE-purified, agarose-embedded full-length chromosomes of strain AT were digested with I-<italic>Ceu</italic>I, an intron-encoded endonuclease with a 26-bp recognition sequence that cleaves specifically in the 23S rRNA gene of many bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Six of the 12 annotated proteins with predicted functions are related to transport and two to protein degradation. Thus, nearly all annotated genes controlling DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell division, and central metabolism occur in the core. In contrast, genes encoding hypothetical proteins are overrepresented in the arms that also are disproportionately endowed with genes for the import of nutrients from the host and protein degradation. Also, 72% of the paralogs are located in the arms. Similar differences in the coding preferences of core and arms are known from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the AY strains the majority of multi-copy genes are organized in clusters of potential mobile units (PMUs). These clusters are composed of genes encoding transposases (<italic>tra5</italic>), primases (<italic>dnaG</italic>), DNA helicases (<italic>dnaB</italic>), thymidilate kinases (<italic>tmk</italic>), Zn-dependent proteases (<italic>hflB</italic>), DNA-binding proteins HU (<italic>himA</italic>), single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (<italic>ssb</italic>) and specialized sigma factors (<italic>sigF</italic>), and a number of genes with unknown function. They are flanked by the transposase and inverted repeats. With this genetic equipment the PMUs are supposed to transpose in a replicative fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In strain AT there are only two putative derivatives of PMUs. One of them (positions 477,626 to 505,731) is similar to PMU1 of strain AY-WB but lacks protein HU that is a nonspecific DNA binder and involved in recombination. Also, the flanking <italic>tra5 </italic>gene on one side and the inverted repeats on both sides are missing. This indicates that this PMU is incomplete. The second putative PMU derivative (positions 282,792 to 286,743) is much more reduced and shares only four ORFs with the larger strain AT PMU derivative. There are three other insertions in the AT chromosome that consist of a geminivirus-related element (positions 69,159 to 76,141) and two putative fragments of prophages (positions 216,227 to 222,362 and 328,508 to 342,905).</p><p>The low number of paralogs, truncated genes and pseudogenes shows that the genome of strain AT is more condensed than the genomes of the AY strains. The occurrence of incomplete PMUs only may indicate that the AT genome is also less prone to insertion and recombination events. This may be supported by the fact that there is only one transposase gene annotated in the AT chromosome while there are 12 and 27 transposases in strains OY-M and AY-WB, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There is also a correlation between the presence of insertion sequences (ISs) and the GC skews. Similar to the different GC skew patterns of strain AT and the AY strains, an irregular skew pattern was identified in the genome of <italic>Mycoplasma mycoides</italic>, 13% of which consists of ISs, whereas <italic>M. mobile </italic>has a regular GC skew and no ISs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the number of PMUs seems to be correlated to the genome size, because strain AT has a smaller genome than the AY strains OY-M and AY-WB. A similar correlation between the frequency of insertion elements and genome size has been found in many other prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, the often obviously truncated PMUs in the AY strains and the low number of PMU derivatives in strain AT, which appear incomplete or severely truncated, indicate that the genomes of phytoplasmas are still undergoing reduction in their size. Thus, expansion or reduction seem to play a major role in phytoplasma genome evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Telomere structures and replication</title><p>Bidirectional replication of linear bacterial chromosomes from an internal <italic>oriC </italic>is faced by the problems of copying the 3' ends and protecting the telomeres from enzymatic degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

In addition, the deduced sequences of the two enzymes present in the terminal protein complex, DNA polymerase I (PolA) and topoisomerase I (TopA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], have no significant homology to the PolA and TopA proteins of strain AT.</p><p>In contrast, the AT chromosome has several features indicating that telomere structure and replication principle are similar to those of <italic>Borrelia </italic>species, <italic>A. tumefaciens </italic>and several linear plasmids and phages; consisting of covalently closed hairpin ends and telomere-resolving enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].

Like the AY strains, many genes coding for amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway are lacking. Due to these restrictions it was suggested that phytoplasmas depend on glycolysis for the generation of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, like some other mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], both strain AT and the AY strains lack the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) by which sugars are imported and phosphorylated in order to feed glycolysis. For the import of sugars, only the components of the ABC transporter for maltose (MalKFGE) are present in strain AT, which were also identified in '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>, the maltose-binding protein MalE also has affinity to trehalose, sucrose and palatinose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, the maltose transporter seems to be adapted to the nutritional requirement of strain AT as maltose is a major transport sugar in apple phloem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and trehalose is a major sugar in the insect hemolymph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, it is not known if and how these sugars are catabolized because specific maltose- and trehalose-degrading enzymes known from other bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] were not identified.</p><p>Strain AT, like the AY strains, possesses the four enzymes (Pgi, PfkA, Fba and TpiA) that are necessary to convert imported phosphorylated sugars into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the upper part of glycolysis (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, in contrast to the AY strains, the proteins of the central, energy-yielding part of glycolysis (GapA, Pgk, Pgm, Eno, PykF) are absent in strain AT. The fate of the trioses putatively produced in the preparative glycolysis is unclear. They may be utilized in the glycerophospholipid metabolism. Of this pathway, genes coding for glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GpsA), phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase (CdsA), CDP-diacylglycerol-serine O-phosphatidyltransferase (PssA), phosphatidylglycero-phosphate synthase (PgsA), phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (Psd), phospholipid phosphatase (PgpB), and lysophospholipase (PldB) were annotated in the AT genome. These enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids. The same enzymes for phospholipid biosynthesis have been reported to be present in AY phytoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The rudimentary glycolysis identified in strain AT raises the question of how ATP and NADH are generated to provide energy and the redox equivalent. Enzymes required for the utilization of energy sources other than carbohydrates, such as arginine in the arginine dihydrolase pathway that is present in many cultivable mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], were not found. However, several cultivable mycoplasmas are known to neither metabolize sugars nor arginine, but to oxidize organic acids such as lactate to acetate and CO<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Candidate nutrients for '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' are malate and citrate that can serve as the sole carbon sources for bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] but have not been reported to be utilized by mycoplasmas. Both are the major organic acids transported in apple phloem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], the plant habitat of the AP agent. Unlike most other mycoplasmas, phytoplasmas have genes coding for symporters of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate (2-HCT) family. These transporters couple the translocation of a solute to the translocation of a co-ion (H<sup>+ </sup>or Na<sup>+</sup>) in the same direction. Some of the symporters ('exchangers') operate in the exchange mode of transport and couple the uptake of a substrate (e. g. malate and/or citrate) to the export of a metabolic end product (e. g. lactate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The 2-HCT symporters recognize either malate or citrate as substrates, the exchanger type for both of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The symporter genes of the AY strains are differently annotated. The proteins deduced from the four genes of strain OY-M were classified as either malate/citrate or Na<sup>+</sup>/citrate symporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and the two genes of the closely related strain AY-WB were annotated to code for Na<sup>+</sup>/malate symporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The deduced four paralogs of strain AT genes are most closely related to proteins of the AY strains (31&#x02013;41% identities). Although the strain AT symporters were annotated as malate-specific, a clear classification of their substrate specificity and mode of translocation is not possible without further studies.</p><p>Gain of metabolic energy, energy conservation and end product depend on the kind of symporter and the enzymes involved in degradation of malate and citrate. Decarboxylation of the malate or citrate substrate is catalyzed by a protein of the malic enzyme family (e. g. SfcA, MalS, MleS, CitM) that shows specificity to either malate, citrate and/or oxalacetate. In the simplest, proton-donating metabolic system, malate is converted to lactate that subsequently is secreted. In other, more complex pathways, intermediates such as oxalacetate and pyruvate are obtained and NADH, NADPH or ATP are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Gain of energy, in particular of ATP, through the catabolism of carboxylic acids by strain AT cannot be evaluated with certainty. It is likely that decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate catalyzed by the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent malic enzyme yields NADH. For the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA the dehydrogenase complex (AcoAB, AceF and Lpd) is present in strain AT. However, the gene encoding phosphotransacetylase (Pta) that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetyl-P was not identified. This enzyme is commonly found in mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and may be among the hypothetical proteins of strain AT. Acetyl-P is converted in an ATP-yielding reaction to acetate by acetate kinase (AckA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This enzyme is present in strain AT and the AY strains.</p><p>Strain AT has, similar to the AY strains, five P-type ATPases (4 MgtA, 1 ZntA) that transport a variety of different compounds, including ions and phospholipids, across a membrane using ATP hydrolysis for energy. F-type ATPases (ATP synthases) that use the transmembrane potential for ATP synthesis were neither identified in strain AT nor in '<italic>Ca</italic>.

As no transport systems for nucleotides and essential nucleic acid precursors were identified in strain AT, it is suggested that there are ATP generation or translocation systems not identified as yet.</p><p>In addition to the transporters described above, the AT chromosome contains 39 ORFs that encode transport and binding proteins. These include ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter systems for dipeptides/oligopeptides (DppDFCBA, OppA), spermidine/putrescine (PotABCD), cobalt (CbiOQ), Mn/Zn (ZnuBCA), and D-methionine (permease and solute binding components). Also, ABC transporters involved in multidrug resistance (EvbHG) were annotated. This genetic equipment is largely the same as identified in the AY strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, amino acid transporter systems other than for D-methionine such as GlnQ and ArtIMPQ that are present in the AY strains are lacking in strain AT. This may indicate that the methionine transport system is not very substrate specific and may also transport other amino acids.

From this finding it was suggested that the difference accounts for the higher virulence of strain OY-W due to a depletion of sugars in the phloem sap and the resulting higher multiplication rate of the phytoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. However, this does not apply for strain AT in which the enzymes of the central part of glycolysis are lacking.</p><p>Other possible virulence factors include two putative hemolysins that are encoded by the ORFs <italic>hlyC </italic>and <italic>tlyC</italic>.

P. mali' is an unusual organism that differs in several aspects significantly not only from '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris', but also from all other mycoplasmas. In comparison to the AY strains, strain AT is characterized by a smaller chromosome, lower GC content, lower number of ORFs and paralogs, fewer PMUs and other insertions and only one transporter type for amino acids. It also seems much better equipped for DNA repair and homologous recombination.</p><p>However, more striking are the differences found with regard to chromosome structure and metabolic capacities. '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' and related phytoplasmas are the first mycoplasmas and the first members of the division <italic>Firmicutes </italic>that are known to have linear chromosomes. The linear chromosome of strain AT is characterized by large TIRs and covalently closed hairpin ends. This combination is unique within the bacteria in which two kinds of linear chromosomes can be distinguished. In one group, represented by <italic>Streptomyces </italic>spp., the linear chromosomes usually possess long TIRs ranging from ten to several hundred kilobases. The ends of the TIRs are protected by covalently attached proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the second system, represented by <italic>Borrelia </italic>spp., the TIRs are imperfect and very short (e.g. 26 bp) and characterized by covalently closed hairpin loops at the ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is unknown whether the particular structure of the strain AT chromosome evolved in either the apple proliferation phytoplasma subclade, in other phytoplasma groups, or in a phytoplasma ancestor. However, <italic>A. laidlawii</italic>, one descendant of the closest putative phytoplasma ancestor, has a circular chromosome, about 1.5 Mb in length. It also remains an enigma why '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' and related phytoplasmas have linear chromosomes. There are arguments for linearity as a promoter of recombination in the free ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. This recombinogenic property seems not to apply for strain AT as the TIRs are identical and apparently integral parts of the compact chromosome.</p><p>'<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' shares with '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' a very limited coding capacity. All are lacking many genes coding for the biosynthesis of amino and fatty acids, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and the phosphotransferase system. Despite the missing PTS, glycolysis is considered to be the major energy-yielding pathway of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris'. Sugars are supposed to be imported by a yet unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, unlike in other mycoplasmas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the central (triose) portion of glycolysis is completely missing in strain AT. Also, alternative energy-yielding pathways present in other mycoplasmas, in which amino acids (mainly arginine), glycerol, fatty acids, or urea are catabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], were not identified in strain AT. The same is true for F-type ATPases (ATP synthases). It thus appears that maltose, malate, and perhaps citrate are the major carbon and energy sources for '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' although no complete catabolic pathways were found. For the degradation of maltose a yet unknown metabolic system is assumed to be used.</p><p>For a long time it was expected that complete genome sequences will provide information on the nutritional requirements of phytoplasmas. The sequence data of both '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. mali' and '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' have revealed the restricted coding potential of phytoplasmas and may explain the failure to cultivate these organisms in cell-free media. The data also indicate that, in contrast to most other mycoplasmas, external sterol is probably not required for phytoplasma growth. However, the question about suitable energy sources cannot be answered as long as the fuels consumed are not known with certainty. Further relevant information may be obtained by annotating hypothetical genes and comparative studies on metabolism. Also, sequences of additional phytoplasma genomes would be helpful to elucidate metabolic features common in phytoplasmas.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sources, isolation and sequencing of DNA</title><p>'<italic>Ca</italic>.

The two resulting <italic>Apa</italic>I fragments were resolved by another PFGE and were either blotted for Southern hybridization with TIR-specific probes or excised from the gel and used as PCR templates. The following primer pairs were used to separately amplify most of the two arms of the strain AT chromosome:</p><p>A, 5'-ACGACTTTCGACAAGCGACT-3'/5'-GTGTTTCTAAGATCTTTGGC-3';</p><p>B, 5'-TGTCATGTATTTGATGCGGG-3'/5'-TTTAGAAGGCAATTTAACCG-3';</p><p>C, 5'-TGGATAGAAACAAAGACTTC-3'/5'-TCTTGTAATGCGGGCGAAAC-3';</p><p>D, 5'-GGAAAAAGGTCTACTTGAAG-3'/5'-AAACCGACACTACCATTACG-3';</p><p>E, 5'-CTCAAATGCCGGTTAATGTG-3'/5'-CAATATCTTTTTTAATCCTCC-3';</p><p>F, 5'-GATACGATATTGAATCAAG-3'/5'-TTTTTTGCTTAAATATTTG-3';</p><p>G, 5'-TGAAGGCTGATGATTTTAAATC-3'/5'-CGTTATTAAGCTTCTCAAAAG-3'.</p><p>For specific sequencing of the TIRs, lambda libraries were constructed from PFGE-purified chromosomal DNA using DASH II and FIX II vectors (Stratagene). Plaque lifts were hybridized with a probe consisting of DNA from the 5' <italic>Apa</italic>I fragment obtained by electroelution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Lambda cloning and plaque lifting were performed as recommended by the supplier of the vector. Digoxigenin (DIG) labeled probes were prepared using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit or the DIG-High Prime Labeling and Detection Kit (both Roche), and plaque lift and Southern blot hybridization were carried out according to the protocol provided by the supplier. For end sequencing of the lambda clones recombinant phage DNA was isolated using the Lambda Mini Kit following the recommendations of the supplier (Qiagen).</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Structural rRNAs and tRNAs were determined using Rfam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] and tRNAscan-SE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. Protein-coding sequences were predicted by Glimmer3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] and annotated in HTGA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>]. Deduced proteins were compared with those of strains AY-WB (accession number CP000061), and OY-M (accession number AP006628) of '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris'. Results were parsed through a script to obtain reciprocal BLASTP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>] hits. Orthologous proteins were predicted using the BLASTP algorithm, considering an e-value of 1-e5 as significant. Alignment length was not taken into account due to the high number of truncated genes in the '<italic>Ca</italic>. P. asteris' strains. The number of protein coding multi-copy genes was estimated based on BLASTP analyses comparing the deduced protein set against itself. Hits were filtered by MSPcrunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>] to exclude protein hits to itself, at a higher e-value than 1-e5 and below an identity of 70%. Cumulative skew analyses were performed with Artemis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BS and ES performed DNA isolation and purification.
