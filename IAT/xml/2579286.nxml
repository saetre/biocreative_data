At this avascular stage, single cancer cells become multicellular foci. In turn, this demands a functional adaptation of clonogenic cancer cells to the new microenvironment created by their own three-dimensional (3D) tissue organization, where ambient pressure and metabolic substrate concentration changes are occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Using an experimental hepatic metastasis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], we reported the angiogenesis-stimulating potential activation in avascular micrometastases prior to hypoxia occurrence, leading to the intratumoral recruitment of vasculature-committed stromal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This pre-angiogenic event is connected to hepatic micrometastasis development, but how the 3D status of cancer cell growth <italic>per se </italic>contributes to angiogenic-stimulating potential upregulation in non-hypoxic micrometastases is unclear.</p><p>Spheroids represent a popular <italic>in vitro </italic>3D tissue structure that mimics <italic>in vivo </italic>tumor tissue organization and microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Within the spheroid, spatial cancer cell arrangements and tissue-like features are constituted that can recapitulate the architecture of the original tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Metabolic and signal gradients, 3D-based cell-cell interactions and communication, and position coordinate-dependent proliferation and gene/protein expression patterns are also established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] which can even affect the expression of important cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because a complex tissue-reconstitution program evolves during compact cancer cell growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, we hypothesized that angiogenic-stimulating factor production may be upregulated during <italic>in vitro </italic>3D-growth of cancer cells, even prior to hypoxia occurrence. However, how this is regulated, which biomarkers are defining the process, and which functional significance it has <italic>in vivo </italic>are unclear questions at the moment.</p><p>The purpose of this work was to study proangiogenic features in a murine model of colorectal carcinoma cells, obtained from non-hypoxic 3D-cultured CT26 cancer cells spheroids, and to evaluate their functional contribution to hepatic metastasis formation. CT26 spheroids were generated by the hanging-drop method and used prior to hypoxic atmosphere development. Proliferation of cancer cells and recruitment of angiogenic endothelial cells and myofibroblasts were studied in subcutaneous tumors and hepatic metastases generated by subcutaneous and intrasplenic injection of 3D-and monolayer-cultured CT26 cancer cells.</p><p>This study demonstrates that culture of CT26 cancer cells as multicellular spheroids leads to the expansion of a LFA-1-expressing cancer cell subpopulation able to further secrete VEGF in response to soluble ICAM-1, via COX-2-dependent mechanism in vitro. In addition, 3D growth-dependent features also endowed cancer cells with an enhanced angiogenic-stimulating potential in vivo, contributing to subcutaneous and metastatic tumor formation. These results suggest that the microenvironment created by the 3D-growth of cancer cells is contributing to the transition from avascular to vascular stages during hepatic colon carcinoma metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell line and maintenance</title><p>Murine colon carcinoma cell line (CT26) was obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

Briefly, hepatic tissue digestion was performed by sequential perfusion of pronase and collagenase, and DNase. Sinusoidal cells were separated in a 17.5% (wt/vol) metrizamide gradient and incubated in glutaraldehyde-treated human albumin-coated dishes for 30 minutes, as a selective adherence step for Kupffer cell depletion. Non-adherent sinusoidal cells were re-plated on type I collagen-coated 24-well plates, at 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml/well, and 2 hours later were washed. HSE cell purity of resulting adherent sinusoidal cells was around 95% as checked by previously used identification parameters: positive endocytosis (acetylated low density lipoprotein, ovalbumin); negative phagocytosis (1 &#x003bc;m latex particles) and CD45 antigen expression; positive lectin binding-site expression (wheat germ and viscum album agglutinins); and negative vitamin A storage (revealed by 328 nm of UV fluorescence).

Hepatic metastases were produced through the intrasplenic injection into anesthetized mice (0.078 mg/kg ketamine and 6.24 mg/kg xilacin) of 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>viable CT26 cells (obtained from monolayer- or 3D-spheroid-cultures) suspended in 0.1 ml of Hanks' Balanced salt solution (HBBS). Mice were cervically-dislocated on the 15<sup>th </sup>day after the injection of cancer cells and livers were removed. Livers were fixed by immersion in Zinc solution for 24 hours at room temperature and, then, paraffin-embedded. A minimum of nine 4-&#x003bc;m thick tissue sections of liver (three groups, separated 1 mm) were stained with H&#x00026;E. An integrated image analysis system (Olympus Microimage 4.0 capture kit) connected to an Olympus BX51TF microscope was used to quantify the number, average diameter, and position coordinates of metastases.

Four micron-thick paraffin sections were obtained from both spheroids and tissue samples and were reacted with 1:50 dilutions of rabbit anti-mouse alpha-smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibody (ASMA) (Zymed, San Francisco, CA), rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson, Madrid, Spain), or rat-anti-mouse LFA-1 monoclonal antibody (Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhousen, Germany), or with 1:25 dilutions of rat anti-mouse Ki67 (Dako, Denmark). Their appropriate secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:100, Dako, Denmark) and rabbit anti-rat antibody (dilution 1:100, Dako, Denmark), respectively. Immuno-labeled cells were detected with an avidin-biotin-phosphatase kit (Vectastain ABC-AP kit, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions.

In these conditions, VEGF secretion potential further increased by 30% and 90% in monolayer- and 3D-spheroid-cultured CT26 cells, respectively, given soluble ICAM-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This remarkable VEGF secretion-stimulating activity of soluble ICAM-1 on 3D-spheroid cultured CT26 cells was consistent with LFA-1-expressing cell number augmentation by 3-fold in 3D-cultured cells compared to monolayer-cultured cells shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. Because COX-2 contributes to colon carcinoma cell production of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], in some experiments, both untreated and soluble ICAM-1-treated monolayer- and 3D-cultured CT26 cells received 1 &#x003bc;g/ml COX-2 inhibitor Celecoxib for 18 hours. VEGF levels did not significantly change in basal condition-cultured CT26 from both 3D-spheroid and monolayer cultures. However, Celecoxib completely abrogated VEGF secretion induced by soluble ICAM-1 on both monolayer- and spheroid-cultured CT26 cells, indicating that VEGF secretion-stimulating activity of soluble ICAM-1 was COX-2-dependent (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>(A) Effect of COX-2 inhibition on VEGF secretion by recombinant soluble ICAM-1-treated CT26 cells.</bold> In some experiments, CT26 cells received 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of celecoxib 30 min prior to treatment with sICAM-1.

Acquisition of this important feature of the cancer phenotype was evidenced by the significant increase of VEGF secretion when CT26 cancer cells were cultured as 3D-spheroids, and by the remarkable angiogenic tract-formation activity provided by 3D-cultured CT26 cells at both subcutaneous tumors and hepatic metastases. This mechanism was contributed by integrin LFA-1, which significantly increased in both 3D-cultured CT26 cells and non-hypoxic avascular CT26 hepatic micrometastases. In turn, over-expression of this integrin enhanced the adhesion of CT26 to ICAM-1-expressing angiogenic hepatic myofibroblasts and endothelial cells; and endowed CT26 cells with the capability to further increase VEGF secretion, via COX-2, in response to soluble ICAM-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), a factor increasing both in the hepatic blood after cancer cell infiltration, and in the peripheral blood of patients affected by numerous cancer types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Neoplastic tissues contain a complex spatial organization of growing cancer cells that is missed in traditional monolayer culture systems. Most of structural and functional features of cancer cells are affected by their position coordinates and ambient pressure within tumor tissue, suggesting that biological and therapeutic studies based on two-dimensional cancer cell cultures may lead to inaccurate conclusions that cannot be easily used for translational research and clinical validations. Multicellular spheroids mimic the microenvironment within avascular tumors, and may represent a simple approach to study inducibility of prometastatic factors. Several studies have reported that cancer cell growth as spheroids involves an altered expression profile of cell adhesion molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and even increased expression of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, how this is regulated and which functional significance it has <italic>in vivo </italic>are, at the moment, unclear questions.</p><p>According to our results, CT26 cells grown either at micrometastatic niches <italic>in vivo</italic>, or as 3D-cancer cell spheroids <italic>in vitro</italic>, markedly increased LFA-1-expressing cell number. Previous studies have already reported that expression of this integrin contributes to hepatic invasion and metastasis of lymphoma, leukemia and breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; that LFA-1 blockade using specific antibodies can inhibit the hepatic colonization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]; and that ICAM-1 deficient mice can prevent post-homing events contributing to the hepatic colonization of T-lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Moreover, HT-29 colon cancer cells grown as spheroids increased CD44 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and stimulation of this specific cell line by CD44-ligand hyaluronan can induce integrin-mediated adhesion and migration via LFA-1 up-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In the present study, the adhesion of 3D-cultured CT26 cells to primary cultured hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells increased by 6-fold, and to proangiogenic hepatic stellate cell-derived myofibroblasts, by 2-fold (preliminary data not shown), compared to monolayer-cultured cells. In both cases, this occurred via LFA-1-dependent mechanism as shown by specific anti-LFA-1 blockade. Unlike other microvessels, hepatic sinusoids exhibit elevated base-line expression of ICAM-1 under normal physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], suggesting that cancer cell expression ofLFA-1 contributes to retention and seeding of liver-infiltrating colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, activated hepatic myofibroblasts also express ICAM-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and, therefore, our results suggest that LFA-1 expression may facilitate the functional interaction of cancer cells with ICAM-1-expressing myofibroblasts recruited into smallest micrometastases during early stromagenesis occurring prior to angiogenesis. This stromal-tumor cell interaction may further contribute to VEGF secretion from3D-growing cancer cells within avascular micrometastases.</p><p>Our study also shows that recombinant soluble ICAM-1 induced VEGF production from LFA-1-expressing colon cancer cells. This mechanism accounted for 30% of VEGF production from monolayer-cultured CT26 cells, but it augmented VEGF production by 3-fold in 3D-cultured cells. Moreover, there was a strict correlation between LFA-1 expression and VEGF production levels in CT26 colon carcinoma cells activated by soluble ICAM-1. In the liver, metastatic cancer cells that have survived to the cytotoxic environment of the microvasculature start to grow in tight association to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and stellate cell-derived myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Both sinusoidal cell types express and secrete ICAM-1 induced by tumor-derived factors. Soluble ICAM-1 level is also significantly higher in patients with liver metastasis than in those without liver metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, upregulation of LFA-1 expression on cancer cells at this early stage of the hepatic metastasis process may contribute to VEGF production by metastatic cells interacting with liver-derived ICAM-1. However, this mechanism may require the LFA-1-stimulating microenvironment created by the early 3D-growth of cancer cells preceding angiogenesis in the pathogenic cascade of the hepatic metastasis process.</p><p>Consistent with this mechanism, it has been reported that both tumor- and host-derived soluble ICAM-1 promote angiogenic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and support tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, our results show for first time that soluble ICAM-1 can directly confer angiogenic-stimulating properties to LFA-1-expressing colon carcinoma cells grown in the hepatic microenvironment. Our results also reveal that the angiogenesis-stimulating potential induced by soluble ICAM-1 on LFA-1-expressing colon carcinoma cells was regulated by cyclooxygenase-2. Upregulation of COX-2 expression has a frequent occurrence in a variety of different tumors including colorectal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and it has been associated to tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Because COX-2 accounted for 30% of VEGF from monolayer-cultured CT26 cells, and for 65% of VEGF from 3D-cultured CT26 cells, our results suggest that tumor-derived VEGF is mainly COX-2-dependent during 3D cancer cell growth at the avascular micrometastasis stage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, based on a comparative proteomic analysis of cytosolic samples from monolayer- and 3D-cultured CT26 cells we have detected the specific over-expression by 3D-cultured cells of a selected group of biomarker proteins including: 60S acidic ribosomal protein-1, ferritin heavy chain, phosphoglycerate kinase-1, estrogen-related receptor alpha, vimentin and 14-3-3 epsilon (data not shown). Because these proteins have already been associated to mechanisms of cancer progression and tumor angiogenesis, new studies are now in progress to analyze the hepatic pro-metastatic role of this selected ensemble of proteins associated to the 3D-growth of CT26 colorectal carcinoma cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that culture of CT26 cancer cells as multicellular spheroids leads to the expression of a distinct proangiogenic protein profile, including the specific expansion of a LFA-1-expressing cancer cell subpopulation able to interact with ICAM-1-expressing hepatic endothelial cells and myofibroblasts, and to increase VEGF secretion in response to membrane and soluble ICAM-1, via COX-2-dependent mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In vivo, CT26 cells also expressed LFA-1 integrin since their earliest 3D-growth of non-hypoxic avascular micrometastasis in the liver, suggesting that 3D-growth-dependent features endowed colorectal cancer cells with an enhanced capability to produce VEGF in response to ICAM-1 provided by tumor-activated hepatic cells. Therefore, the microenvironment created by the 3D-growth of cancer cells may <italic>per se </italic>promote the transition from avascular to vascular stage during hepatic colon carcinoma metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MV performed most of <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies and flow cytometry; AJ and CS carried out proteomic studies; AL and FJM performed immuno-histochemical studies; BA and IM contributed to <italic>in vitro </italic>studies; LM participated in its design and coordination, and contributed to <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>studies; FVV conceived of the study, participated in its design, coordination, and wrote this manuscript.
