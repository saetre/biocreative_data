Active human TFIIIC consists of five subunits. However, an inactive form has also been isolated that lacks one of the five subunits, called TFIIIC110. A model was proposed in which pol III transcription might be regulated by the specific induction of TFIIIC110, allowing formation of active TFIIIC from the inactive form. We have tested this model by transient transfection of HeLa and HEK293 cells with a vector expressing TFIIIC110. We have also made stably transfected HeLa cell lines that carry a doxycycline-inducible version of the cDNA for TFIIIC110. We show that the induced TFIIIC110 enters the nucleus, binds other TFIIIC subunits and is recruited to tRNA and 5S rRNA genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, little or no effect is seen on the expression of pol III transcripts. The data argue against the model that pol III transcription can be effectively modulated through the specific induction of TFIIIC110.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>TFIIIC is a large DNA-binding factor that directly recognizes the promoter sequences found within most pol III-transcribed genes, including tRNA and 7SL RNA genes and the adenoviral VA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). It is also required for transcription of 5S rRNA genes, although in this case its recruitment is dependent on an additional polypeptide called TFIIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Indeed, it is probable that TFIIIC is used by all pol III templates in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, although it is not necessary for pol III transcription of mammalian U6 and 7SK RNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>).</p><p>Human TFIIIC has been purified from HeLa cells as a complex of five subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). These are commonly referred to as TFIIIC220, TFIIIC110, TFIIIC102, TFIIIC90 and TFIIIC63, according to their approximate molecular masses. An alternative nomenclature of TFIIIC&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4; and &#x0025b; has also been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). The complex is stable, as the subunits remain associated following immunoprecipitation and washing in 1 M NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Cloning of cDNAs for all five subunits has allowed confirmation that each is a bona fide component of TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). However, the complex has also been purified with the TFIIIC110 subunit missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Furthermore, calculations based on metabolic labeling suggested that TFIIIC from cycling HeLa cells contains half as much TFIIIC110 as TFIIIC220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). TFIIIC complexes with or without the 110 kDa subunit were dubbed TFIIIC2a and TFIIIC2b, respectively, and shown to be resolved on non-denaturing gels or by gradient chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Although the two forms produced identical footprints and had similar DNA-binding affinities, the complex without TFIIIC110 was unable to support transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). These observations lead to a model in which TFIIIC activity could be regulated by reversible interaction of the TFIIIC110 subunit with the remainder of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The interaction might be controlled by phosphorylation, as TFIIIC2b could be generated by phosphatase treatment of fractions containing active TFIIIC2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The model was proposed to explain pol III transcriptional induction observed when HeLa cells are stimulated with serum or with adenoviral E1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The E1A oncoprotein of adenovirus can stimulate pol III transcription, probably through several complementary mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Hoeffler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) reported that the ratio of active TFIIIC2a to inactive TFIIIC2b, as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), is higher in HeLa cells infected with wild-type adenovirus than in cells infected with the E1A deletion mutant dl312. In support of this, western blotting revealed lower levels of TFIIIC110 following dl312 infection, compared with wild-type virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). EMSA analysis also suggested that the ratio of TFIIIC2a to TFIIIC2b is elevated in the E1A-transformed human embryonic kidney cell line 293 and in two SV40-transformed lines of murine fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Subsequent studies found that all five subunits of TFIIIC are overexpressed in the SV40-transformed fibroblasts compared to untransformed parental cells, although the effect appears strongest for TFIIIC110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>The rate of synthesis of pol III products is influenced strongly in mammalian cells by serum availability. Hoeffler <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) reported that the relative proportion of TFIIIC2a to TFIIIC2b was reduced in HeLa cells grown in low serum, an effect which correlated with the reduced transcriptional activity. Consistent with this, western blotting revealed a decrease in expression of TFIIIC110 under low serum conditions, whereas TFIIIC220 levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). A selective change in TFIIIC110 expression was therefore proposed as a mechanism allowing the pol III machinery to adapt to serum availability.</p><p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was based on correlative data&#x02014;relatively high ratios of TFIIIC2a to TFIIIC2b and of TFIIIC110 to TFIIIC220 seen in transcriptionally active extracts from cells grown in the presence of E1A or high serum. However, these observations did not distinguish between cause and effect. The data are compatible with the possibility that selective loss of TFIIIC110 might occur as a consequence of down-regulated transcription, rather than having a causative role. For example, surplus TFIIIC might be degraded when active transcription is not occurring and TFIIIC110 might simply be less stable than the other subunits and therefore removed first, allowing accumulation of TFIIIC2b. Therefore, we tested the model directly by determining whether a specific induction of TFIIIC110 is sufficient to stimulate pol III transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin.

This construct was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells along with the adenoviral VA1 gene, the pol III-transcribed gene used in the original studies by Hoeffler, Kovelman and Roeder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). A vector encoding GFP transcribed from the CMV promoter was cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Western blotting for the HA tag confirmed that the exogenous TFIIIC110 protein was expressed in the transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, little or no effect was seen in multiple experiments on the level of VA1 transcript, as assayed by primer extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>The lack of response in HEK293 cells might be explained by the fact that this line expresses E1A, which was reported to elevate TFIIIC110 expression; the ratio of this polypeptide with respect to other TFIIIC subunits may already be high in these cells, such that TFIIIC2a predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Therefore, we repeated the experiment in HeLa cells, which were reported to have a significant fraction of TFIIIC2b, which lacks the TFIIIC110 subunit. In contrast to HEK293 cells, a modest, dose-dependent induction of VA1 RNA was observed when the HA-TFIIIC110 expression vector was transfected into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). After normalization to the cotransfected GFP internal control, the average response was &#x0223c;1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR analysis was used to determine if levels of the endogenous pol III transcripts are influenced by transient transfection of the HA-TFIIIC110 vector. We examined expression of 5S rRNA and tRNA genes, both of which require TFIIIC for their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). No reproducible induction was observed for 5S rRNA, whereas tRNA showed a slight response of &#x0223c;1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Although, this assay measures the steady-state level of 5S rRNA, our tRNA primers are specific for short-lived primary transcripts, which are considered to reflect the rate of ongoing transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This approach therefore provided limited support for the model that class III gene expression can be stimulated by a specific increase in the ratio of TFIIIC110 to other TFIIIC subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable induction of TFIIIC110 in HeLa cells has little effect on expression of tRNA and 5S rRNA</title><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref> measured levels of endogenous transcripts in the total cell population. However, immunofluorescence analysis of GFP expression from the cotransfected control vector indicated that many of the HeLa cells remain untransfected under the conditions of our assays (data not shown). Since the presence of untransfected cells may partially mask a response, we produced HeLa cell clones that were stably transfected in the presence of a selectable marker, to ensure that the entire population receives the expression vector. The TFIIIC110 cDNA was subcloned into pTRE2hyg, which carries a doxycycline-responsive promoter. This was then used to produce multiple clones in which HA-tagged TFIIIC110 can be induced specifically by addition of doxycycline to the culture medium. Individual clones varied considerably in the levels of HA-TFIIIC110 that were produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also observed clonal variation in the expression of tRNA and 5S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis revealed no consistent change in the expression of pol III transcripts following induction of HA-TFIIIC110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).</p><p>The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> predicts that pol III transcription might be more sensitive to TFIIIC110 induction under low serum conditions. Therefore, we cultured HeLa cells in 0.5% serum, as in the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). This treatment was sufficient to cause a marked reduction in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Trypan blue staining did not reveal any substantial apoptosis (data not shown). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), tRNA expression was markedly diminished in low serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This was accompanied by a slight decrease in expression of endogenous TFIIIC110, as revealed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). HA-TFIIIC110 remained inducible under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), but we again found that its induction has little or no effect on tRNA or 5S rRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).</p><p>Control experiments were conducted to verify that the exogenous HA-TFIIIC110 is incorporated into TFIIIC complexes. Sequence analysis using the PSORT II programme (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp"/>) revealed a strong nuclear localization signal (NLS) in TFIIIC220, but not in the other TFIIIC subunits. Unincorporated HA-TFIIIC110 may therefore be retained in the cytoplasm. Indeed, cytoplasmic fluorescence was detected with antibody against the HA tag following addition of doxycycline to the stable transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, an intense immunofluorescence signal was also observed from the nuclei. This is consistent with the possibility that although some of the induced protein may remain unincorporated and hence in the cytoplasm, a significant proportion associates with TFIIIC220 to form a complex that enters the nucleus. Complex assembly is supported by the finding that HA-TFIIIC110 can be coimmunoprecipitated from doxycycline-treated cells using antiserum against TFIIIC220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Other TFIIIC subunits also associate with the HA-TFIIIC110, as shown by the fact that anti-HA antibody coimmunoprecipitates TFIIIC90 following doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This interaction is specific, since TFIIIC90 is not detected after control immunoprecipitations using antibodies against RB or cyclin D1. In addition, HA-TFIIIC110 is detected by ChIP at chromosomal tRNA and 5S rRNA genes, but not at the gene encoding TFIIIC220, which we used as a pol II-transcribed negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, the pol II-specific transcription factor TFIIB is detected at the TFIIIC220 gene, but not at tRNA or 5S rRNA genes, as expected. These data confirm that the doxycycline-induced exogenous HA-TFIIIC110 is incorporated into TFIIIC complexes that are recruited to the appropriate target genes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, ChIP with an antibody that recognizes total TFIIIC110 (i.e. both endogenous and HA-tagged forms), shows no increase in gene occupancy in response to doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). The data suggest that although stable transfection with an inducible construct is able to raise the total level of TFIIIC110 in HeLa cells, it has little impact on the amount of this subunit that is assembled onto promoters. This is consistent with the lack of a significant transcriptional response.</p></sec><sec><title>Stable induction of Brf1 in HeLa cells can stimulate expression of tRNA and 5S rRNA</title><p>The data above show that specific induction of TFIIIC110 in HeLa cells has minimal effect on the expression of endogenous tRNA and 5S rRNA, even though the induced protein interacts with other TFIIIC subunits and is recruited to the appropriate template genes. Since this can be viewed as a negative result, it was necessary to confirm that the system we have used is amenable to transcriptional induction if a limiting factor is employed. We chose to try the Brf1 subunit of TFIIIB, as this has been shown to stimulate tRNA and 5S rRNA gene transcription when titrated into HeLa cell extracts. Therefore, we prepared stably transfected HeLa cell clones that carry doxycycline-inducible HA-tagged Brf1, using exactly the same approach as described above for HA-TFIIIC110. Blotting for the HA tag confirmed that HA-Brf1 can be induced in these cells by the addition of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A high proportion of this protein is localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, RT&#x02013;PCR analysis showed that tRNA and 5S rRNA levels are increased significantly in response to induction of HA-Brf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>). This confirms that the doxycycline-regulated system used in these experiments can be exploited to activate pol III transcription. Therefore, we infer that a specific increase in the level of TFIIIC110 may not be an effective mechanism for pol III regulation in HeLa cells, as postulated.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In these experiments we have tested directly the model that TFIIIC110 is &#x02018;a central controlling subunit&#x02019; for pol III transcription of TFIIIC-dependent promoters, as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Our data do not support this idea. A weak induction by TFIIIC110 was observed for the VA1 and tRNA genes in transiently transfected cells, but this was only around 1.5-fold. Furthermore, this small effect was not reproducible in stably transfected cells. 5S rRNA gene expression did not respond to TFIIIC110 induction under either circumstance. In contrast, induction of Brf1 produces a strong increase in tRNA and 5S rRNA expression under the same conditions. We have confirmed that the induced TFIIIC110 can interact with other TFIIIC subunits, enter the nucleus and be recruited specifically to target genes. However, this has little effect on the overall amounts of TFIIIC110 being recruited to chromosomal genes. The data suggest that this subunit is not limiting in the contexts we have investigated.</p><p>It was reported that several unidentified polypeptides co-purified with inactive TFIIIC2b and were not associated with active TFIIIC2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In particular, a polypeptide of 77 kDa co-fractionated consistently with TFIIIC2b, although it was never detected by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). As it was unclear whether this was a contaminant or had functional significance, the model of TFIIIC regulation by differential interaction with TFIIIC110 included the possibility that TFIIIC2b might contain an additional 77 kDa subunit as well as lacking TFIIIC110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). As far as we are aware, the identity of this putative subunit has not been reported. Clearly, the possibility of its involvement has not been addressed by our study.</p><p>Experiments carried out by Shen <italic>et al.</italic> lead them to question the existence of TFIIIC2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). These authors raised an antiserum against TFIIIC110 that, when used in an EMSA, was able to block all the DNA-binding activity of TFIIIC in a HeLa extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). This finding clearly conflicts with the report that a significant fraction of HeLa cell TFIIIC exists in a form (i.e. TFIIIC2b) that lacks TFIIIC110 but is undiminished in its DNA-binding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). We have been unable to address this issue because our antisera against TFIIIC110 are unable to block or supershift in an EMSA. Our study has specifically examined the hypothesis that selective induction of TFIIIC110 is a significant regulatory mechanism <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Another unresolved question with regard to mammalian TFIIIC concerns the identity of TFIIIC1, a TFIIIC-associated fraction that was found to be required for transcription of all types of pol III template using partially-purified reconstituted systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). Although candidate components of TFIIIC1 have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), the functional significance of these polypeptides has not been demonstrated, as far as we are aware. Indeed, efficient pol III transcription of a U6 gene has been reconstituted more recently using a combination of recombinant and highly purified proteins without any TFIIIC1 fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). It was suggested that TFIIIC1 might in fact correspond to Bdp1, an essential subunit of TFIIIB that dissociates readily during purification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). This possibility is supported by the finding that Bdp1 co-fractionates with TFIIIC1 activity and can substitute for TFIIIC1 fractions in a reconstituted transcription assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>The model of TFIIIC110 induction was proposed as a mechanism to explain the activation of pol III transcription by E1A and by serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). We have not examined whether E1A can selectively stimulate TFIIIC110 expression, but our data suggest that this would have little impact on transcriptional output, at least in HeLa cells. Other documented mechanisms may instead account for pol III activation under these circumstances. Yoshinaga <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) demonstrated that overall levels of TFIIIC had increased 4- to 8-fold 30 h after adenovirus infection of HeLa cells. In addition, E1A can overcome RB-mediated repression of pol III transcription, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Serum stimulation leads to a phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of RB and so can also derepress the pol III machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). Furthermore, pol III transcription is directly activated by c-Myc and Erk, both of which are serum-inducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Combinations of these mechanisms may be sufficient to explain pol III responsiveness to E1A and to serum.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Y. Shen and A. Berk for the Ab4 antibody, J.
