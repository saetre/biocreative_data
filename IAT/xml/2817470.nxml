Although its substrates are well characterized, no direct regulators have been defined. Here, we show that SIRT1 associates with SKI-interacting protein (SKIP) and modulates its activity as a coactivator of retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Binding assays indicated that SKIP interacts with RAR in a RA-dependent manner, through a region that overlaps the binding site for SIRT1. SKIP augmented the transcriptional activation activity of RAR by cooperating with SRC-1, and SIRT1 suppressed SKIP/SRC-1-enhanced RAR transactivation activity. The suppression was dependent on the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 and was enhanced by a SIRT1 activator, resveratrol. In contrast, the suppression was relieved by SIRT1 knockdown, overexpression of SKIP and treatment with a SIRT1 inhibitor, splitomicin. Upon SKIP overexpression, the recruitment of SIRT1 to the endogenous <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic> promoter was severely impaired, and SKIP was recruited to the promoter instead. Finally, resveratrol treatment inhibited RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, accompanied by reductions in the neuronal marker <italic>nestin</italic> and a RAR target gene, <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic>. This inhibition was relieved by either knockdown of SIRT1 or overexpression of SKIP. These data suggest that SIRT1 and SKIP play reciprocal roles in the regulation of RAR activity, which is implicated in the regulation of RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Human SIRT1 (sirtuin1), one of the seven mammalian SIRT homologs, is closely related to yeast Sir2, which possesses NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent class III histone deacetylase activity. Recent studies strongly suggest that mammalian SIRT1, like yeast Sir2, is involved in transcriptional silencing of integrated reporter genes by chromatin modification via histone deacetylation, DNA damage responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>),and life span extension following caloric restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). SIRTI also deacetylates non-histone proteins, including various transcription factors that are involved in growth regulation, the stress response and endocrine signaling. For example, SIRT1 negatively regulates p53-dependent apoptosis by deacetylating p53 in response to cellular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). Other substrates of SIRT1, including DNA repair protein Ku70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), FOXO family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9">8&#x02013;9</xref>) and NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), are involved in the stress response. In energy metabolism and insulin signaling, SIRT1 activates gluconeogenesis and represses glycolysis in the liver via deacetylation of PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Increasing levels of SIRT1 in the pancreatic &#x003b2; cells of mice resulted in repressed UCP2 transcription and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Upon binding, SIRT1 deacetylates the androgen receptor (AR) and represses DHT-induced AR signaling in human prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, it has been speculated that SIRT1 is widely involved in mammalian physiology, with roles in metabolism, senescence, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. In addition, recent studies have suggested a role for SIRT1 in cellular differentiation. SIRT1 represses nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b3; by docking with its co-repressors, NcoR and SMRT, and attenuates adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). SIRT1 also regulates muscle gene expression and differentiation by deacetylating MyoD and PCAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Moreover, SIRT1 participates in the growth and maturation of the embryo and in gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Nevertheless, a role of SIRT1 in neuronal differentiation, specially derived from embryonic stem cells, remains largely unknown.</p><p>To identify additional targets of SIRT1, we first performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human complementary DNA (cDNA) library using SIRT1 as bait, and found that SIRT1 is functionally associated with SKI-interacting protein (SKIP), which has been described as a transcriptional coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Here, we provide the first evidence for a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) regulatory pathway controlled reciprocally by SIRT1 and SKIP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>All cDNAs were made according to standard methods and verified by sequencing. The full-length SKIP cDNA was amplified by PCR from a HeLa cDNA library and was inserted into the 5&#x02032;-XhoI and 3&#x02032;-BamHI or 3&#x02032;-BglII sites of each vector. Expression plasmids for the SIRT1 wild type and point mutant (SIRT1 HY) are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). For yeast two-hybrid screening, the full-length SIRT1 cDNA was inserted into the bait plasmid pBTM116 (LexA DBD vector). SIRT1 deletion mutants were created by PCR amplification and were also subcloned into pBTM116. For transient transfections, the Flag-tagged SIRT1 or SKIP gene was placed in the pcDNA3 vector. For the localization assay, GFP-tagged recombinant constructs were created in pEGFP-C3 (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively.

To understand the role of SKIP in other nuclear receptor-mediated transcriptional activations, we first investigated whether SKIP could interact with other nuclear receptors and the ligand-dependency requirement for the interaction. As shown by the yeast two-hybrid assays, SKIP interacts with RAR&#x003b1; and ER&#x003b1; in a ligand-dependent manner, whereas no ligand dependency was observed for the interaction between SKIP and VDR, and no interactions were detected between SKIP and TR&#x003b1; or RXR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). We selected RAR&#x003b1; for further studies because of its ligand-dependent interaction with SKIP. Subsequent domain-mapping assays using a series of N- and C-terminal deletions of SKIP indicated that RAR&#x003b1; can bind to the central region of SKIP, covering amino acids 174&#x02013;373, which overlaps with the SIRT1 binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, SKIP enhanced and SIRT1 repressed the RA-dependent transcriptional activation of RAR&#x003b1; in a dose-dependent manner. Further assays using a deacetylase-defective SIRT1 mutant (HY) demonstrated that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 is required for RAR&#x003b1; repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). When SIRT1 was depleted by siRNA treatment, RAR&#x003b1; activity increased markedly, supporting that SIRT1 itself mediates RAR&#x003b1; repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). As expected from another report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), SKIP and a steroid receptor coactivator, SRC-1, cooperated for RA-induced RAR&#x003b1; transcriptional activation, but this cooperation was again diminished by SIRT1 in a deacetylase activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). To confirm the deacetylase activity-dependent RAR&#x003b1; repression mediated by SIRT1, a known SIRT1 inhibitor, splitomicin (Splito) and an activator, RES, were utilized. RAR&#x003b1; repression by SIRT1 was impaired completely by splitomicin. However, RAR&#x003b1; repression was achieved by RES without SIRT1 over-expression, and this repression was released by SKIP over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). We next investigated whether this competition for RAR&#x003b1; binding occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, by ChIP assays. Under normal conditions, SIRT1 was recruited to the chromatinized <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic> promoter in the presence of RA, but upon SKIP overexpression, SKIP replaced SIRT1 on the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>F).

These cells represent a murine embryonic carcinoma cell line that possesses pluripotency, like embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), and efficiently differentiates to neuron and glial cells upon RA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).

We identified SKIP as a novel binding partner of SIRT1. Extensive binding assays revealed that in addition to binding to SIRT1, SKIP interacts with RAR&#x003b1; through a binding domain that overlaps that for SIRT1. We consistently found that SIRT1 competes with SKIP for RAR&#x003b1; binding at the protein level and at the chromatin-associated <italic>RAR&#x003b2;2</italic> promoter. This overexpression based competition resulted in differential regulation of RAR&#x003b1; transactivation, with SKIP enhancing and SIRT1 repressing the transcriptional activity of RAR&#x003b1;. Finally, we provided evidence to suggest that the reciprocal regulation of RAR&#x003b1;-activated transcription by SIRT1 and SKIP may account for the differential regulation of RAR&#x003b1; during RA-induced neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Our investigation raises questions regarding how SIRT1 represses but SKIP stimulates RAR&#x003b1;-dependent transcription. Recent studies have provided evidence of SIRT1 repression of transcriptional activation mediated by other nuclear receptors such as PPAR and AR. SIRT1 represses PPAR&#x003b3; activity by binding to its cofactors, NCoR and SMRT, although it was uncertain whether SIRT1 deacetylates PPAR&#x003b3; or histones, or both, at target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). In the case of AR, SIRT1 binds and deacetylates AR to repress AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Another study on AR reported that AR antagonism requires SIRT1 binding and deacetylation of histone H3 locally at the AR-responsive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The SIRT1-mediated hypoacetylation of histone H3 has also been implicated in the suppression of MyoD-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In a study on the role of SIRT1 in histone binding and histone modification, when SIRT1 was forced to interact with a synthetic Gal4-responsive promoter, it deacetylated histones H3 (at lysine 9) and H4 (at lysine 16), and recruited histone H1 to the promoter through an interaction with the N-terminal portion of SIRT1, thereby reducing the expression of the reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The involvement of SIRT1 in other histone modifications such as methylation is indicated by the finding that SIRT1 interacts directly with and deacetylates histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, specific for H3K9. The deacetylation of SUV39H1 at its active site increases SUV39H1 activity, thereby elevating the levels of H3K9me3 to mediate transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Our data revealed that SIRT1 repression of RAR&#x003b1; transactivation requires the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. Transient transfection assays also revealed that Gal4-SIRT1 could repress the expression of a reporter gene (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether the deacetylation of RAR&#x003b1;, histone or SUV39H1 is responsible for SIRT1 repression of RAR&#x003b1;-dependent transcription. Although the mechanism of SIRT1-mediated repression is interesting, here we focused on the switching mechanism from SIRT1 repression to SKIP activation, which provides another level of SIRT1 regulation. We demonstrated that overexpressed SKIP competes with and displaces SIRT1 from a repression complex at the RAR&#x003b1;-activated promoter, resulting in transcriptional activation.</p><p>SKIP has been described as a coactivator of Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and nuclear receptors, including VDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), as well as a co-repressor for Checkpoint Suppressor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), MAGE-A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) and Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) in association with the co-repressors NCoR/SMRT and/or HDAC. Interestingly, SKIP plays a dual role in CBF1- and nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. SKIP represses CBF1-dependent transcription by associating with SMRT. To activate the CBF1-repressed promoter, NotchIC displaces SMRT from the repressor complex and interacts with SKIP and CBF1. SKIP also regulates nuclear receptor-mediated transcription by switching its association with co-repressor NCoR/SMRT and coactivator p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In this study, we provide evidence for another role of SKIP in regulation: activated or overexpressed SIRT1 competes with and displaces SKIP from the activation complex at the RAR&#x003b1;-activated promoter, resulting in transcriptional repression.</p><p>Our study provides the first evidence for a RAR regulatory pathway controlled reciprocally by SIRT1 and SKIP, although the biological significance of the reciprocal regulation remains unknown. Retinoic acid (RA) is used to differentiate stem cells into neurons by inducing neuron-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), but its detailed mechanism is still poorly understood. In this study, we used P19 EC cells to delineate the molecular mechanism underlying RA-induced neuronal differentiation and presented the reciprocal functions of SIRT1 and SKIP. SIRT1 activation by RES repressed RA-induced differentiation, probably through the targeted repression of the <italic>nestin</italic> and other RA target genes, whereas SIRT1 knockdown or SKIP overexpression stimulated RA-induced differentiation. SIRT1 has been implicated in the regulation of differentiation through adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). During the neurogenesis of neuronal stem cells in response to environmental redox, SIRT1 represses Mash1 transcription by forming a complex with Hes1, but SIRT1 displacement allows Hes1 to recruit CBP to activate Mash1 transcription: SIRT1 drives astrocyte fate, whereas the release of SIRT1 drives neuronal fate. SIRT1 is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), where it may cause the cells to die after exposure to ROS, leaving healthy cells to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Moreover, in embryonic cells, the SIRT1 inhibits the p53-mediated suppression of <italic>Nanog</italic> expression, thus allowing the cells to express <italic>Nanog</italic> and maintain their self-renewal potential. However, the role of SIRT1 in the RA-induced differentiation of ES cells has not been determined. Based on the present study using ES-like P19 cells, we propose that SIRT1 may associate with RAR and repress RAR-activated transcription in undifferentiated P19 cells, and that SIRT1 disappears or SKIP displace SIRT1 from RAR to enhance RAR-mediated transcription during the neuronal differentiation in response to RA, although the precise molecular interplay among RAR, SKIP and SIRT1 remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (KRF-2008-313-C00864 and R01-2008-000-10902-0 to E.-J.K.), and (R01-2007-000-10308-0 to S.-J.U.).
