Although intensive research on pathological phenomena of endometrial cancer is currently going on, but exact cause and biological aspects of this disease are not well described yet. In addition to well-documented roles of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in hypopituitary ovarian (HPO) axis, the agonistic or antagonistic analogs (or both) of GnRH have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of human gynecologic cancers. Thus, in the present study, we further examined the possibility that GnRH induces integrin beta3 and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1/2 and p38, to inhibit the growth of HEC1A endometrial cancer cell line. As a result, both GnRH-I and GnRH-II resulted in a significant increase in integrin beta3 expression and evoked the activation of FAK in a time-dependent manner in these cells. In addition, these analogs induced an activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner as downstream pathways of FAK. It appears that GnRH-II has much greater effect on the activation of FAK, ERK1/2 and p38 compared to GnRH-I in these cells. Further, we demonstrated that the growth inhibition of HEC1A cells by GnRH-I or GnRH-II is involved in the activation of integrin-FAK and ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Taken together, these results suggest that GnRH may be involved in the inhibition of endometrial cancer cell growth via activation of integrin beta3 and FAK as a direct effect. This knowledge could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the therapeutic action of GnRH and its biomedical application for the treatment against endometrial cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Endometrial carcinoma is the most common neoplasm of the female genital tract, accounting for nearly one half of all gynecologic cancers in the Western world. It is estimated that approximately 40,000 new cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States and about 7,000 women die of this disease, indicating that endometrial carcinoma is thus the fourth most common malignancy and the eighth leading cause of cancer-related death in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although intensive research on pathological phenomena of endometrial cancer is currently going on, but exact cause and biological aspects of this disease are not well elucidated yet.</p><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the hypothalamic hormone that mediates reproductive competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An intermittent GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus acts upon its receptor in the anterior pituitary to regulate the production and release of two gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In addition to reproductive roles of GnRH in hypo-pituitary ovarian (HPO) axis, GnRH-I, a classical form of GnRH, has an inhibitory effect on cell growth in human mammary, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate tumors and has been implicated as an antiproliferative factor of gynecologic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In particular, the agonistic or antagonistic analogs (or both) of GnRHs have been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of human ovarian cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner through activation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A second form of GnRH, GnRH-II, was expressed at the transcriptional level and GnRH-II induced an inhibition of the ovarian cancer cell growth in our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, several in vitro investigations showed that GnRH agonists and the GnRH antagonist, i.e., cetrorelix, can inhibit the proliferation of Ishikawa and HEC1A human endometrial cancer lines and primary cultures of human endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Integrins modulate intracellular signals by growth factor receptors and play a central role in cell migration. An integrin heterodimer generally consists of noncovalently linked &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits, each subunit having a large extracellular domain, a single membrane spanning domain and a short, noncatalytic cytoplasmic tail. There are 18 &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits that form at least 25 distinct pairs of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; heterodimers with different ligand specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition to the previously reported antiproliferative effect, integrin &#x003b1; plays an important role in the migratory/invasive behavior of melanoma cells expressing GnRH receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition to controlling cell adhesion and shape, integrins also transmit signals either by physical association with several growth factor receptors or directly through recruitment of non-receptor tyrosine kinases from the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Although molecular events of integrins have been recently uncovered in various cell types, their role in tumorigenesis is yet to be defined. Thus, it is of interest to examine whether or not integrins and FAK may be involved in GnRH-induced growth inhibition in endometrial cancer cells. In the present study, we further investigated effect of GnRH on the proliferation of HEC1A endometrial cancer cell line, through integrin and its downstream effecter molecules, i.e., FAK and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>A GnRH-I analog, Trp (6), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd.

Thus it would be assumed that HEC1A cell proliferation is dose-dependently decreased by GnRH-I and -II at these concentrations.</p><p>A further support for GnRH influence on cell proliferation was provided in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Davidson et al. demonstrated that activation of the GnRH receptor resulted in both cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling and GnRH (10<sup>-7 </sup>M) increased adhesiveness of HEK293 cells overexpressing GnRH receptor. A cytoskeletal remodeling was dependent on FAK, c-Src, ERK and Rac and independent from the classic phospholipase C signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. GnRH-dependent intracellular signaling events for downstream of PKC have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Several groups have demonstrated that GnRH receptor occupancy resulted in the activation of ERK and c-<italic>jun </italic>N-terminal protein kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], members of the MAPK superfamily. GnRH activation of the JNK cascade is dependent on the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In addition to the ERK and JNK cascades, the MAPK superfamily includes the p38 kinase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] reported that GnRH can stimulate activation of the p38 kinase pathway. Activation of the p38 kinase by GnRH requires PKC, suggesting that GnRH-induced p38 MAPK activation may selectively contribute to the regulation of c-<italic>fos </italic>protooncogene expression, but not c-<italic>jun </italic>or the glycoprotein hormone &#x003b1;-subunit gene. Recently, we demonstrated that binding of GnRH-I (a classical form of GnRH) and GnRH-II (a second form of GnRH) to the GnRH-I receptor activates ERK1/2 through a PKC-dependent pathway and is essential for GnRH-induced anti-proliferation of ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this study, we clearly demonstrated that GnRH-I or GnRH-II resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in HEC1A cells, suggesting these MAPKs are involved in GnRH-I or GnRH-II induced cell growth inhibition of endometrial cancer cells. It is of interest that GnRH-II induced much greater expression of pERK1/2 or pp38 in these cells compared to GnRH-I, suggesting that GnRH-II may have a greater effect on the activation of pERK1/2 or pp38 compared to that of GnRH-I in HEC1A endometrial cancer cells.</p><p>Immunohistochemical studies for human endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle revealed a sudden increase in &#x003b2;3-integrin expression in luminal and glandular epithelial cells at mid secretory phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It was of interest that the overexpression of integrin &#x003b2;3 subunit suppressed tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. So far, ligand binding and clustering are known as an important step for full integrin function and the recruitment of downstream signal transduction cascade molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Numerous studies have suggested that &#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrins are overexpressed in solid tumors, and that this overexpression plays a role in tumor growth and invasion. It was speculated that &#x003b2;3 overexpression in glioma cells suppresses, rather than stimulates, glioma growth, but that this occurs exclusively <italic>in vivo </italic>and not <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that the growth and metastasis of transplanted tumors in mice showed lacking of specific cell adhesion receptors, integrins or selectins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, integrin &#x003b2;3 or selectin null mice showed increased primary tumor growth <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this study, GnRH-I and -II can increase integrin &#x003b2;3 expression in HEC1A cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that GnRH may be a direct regulator of integrin &#x003b2;3 expression and play a pivotal role as a growth inhibitor by regulating its expression in endometrial cancer cells.</p><p>It is also apparent that the GnRH receptor, like many other heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors, can also activate monomeric G protein molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The activation of these monomeric pathways has been shown to mediate important effects of GnRH in gonadotropes such as control of gonadotropin hormone subunit transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A previous study has also shown that in many cell types, stimulation of Gi- or Gq-coupled receptors causes FAK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. FAK also has been reported to bind to the intracellular regions of &#x003b2;-integrin subunits, and to play a pivotal role as a signal integrator downstream of cell-ECM interactions and other receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that GnRH induced FAK phosphorylation in HEC1A endometrial cancer cells. GnRH-I induced FAK phosphorylation at 5 min and decreased within 30 min. On the other hand, GnRH-II increased FAK phosphorylation after 5 min and reached maximum rate at 20 min following treatment. Based on these observations, it can be suggested that activation of FAK in HEC1A cells by GnRH is mediated by elevated integrin &#x003b2;3 expression. FAK has known to be a regulator of ERK activation in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Phosphorylation of ERK was induced by treatment with GnRH-I and -II in this study as shown in the Results. Many substrates of ERK are localized in the nucleus and cytosol. In addition, ERK phosphorylates many cytoskeletal elements and is important for the determination of cellular morphology, and can serve as anchor proteins that direct ERK to their proper locations. In this study, we did not see any changes of cellular morphology and adhesion property in these cells (Data not shown). Thus, we suggest that ERK might interact with nuclear substrates such as transcriptional factors rather than cytoplasmic substrates such as cytoskeletal elements.</p><p>In our previous study, we demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of GnRH-II in ovarian cancer cells may involve p38 MAPK, which led us to investigate the role of other MAPK family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To investigate the signal pathway involved in the antiproliferative effect by GnRH-I and -II, the activation of p38 in HEC1A cells was examined by immunoblot analysis using the phospho-specific MAPK antibody after treatment with GnRH-I and -II. The p38 MAPK is activated by the phosphorylation on tyrosine 180 and tyrosine 182 in the activation loop and modulates cell cycle for the response to environmental stress, hormones, ligands that bind to G protein-coupled receptors, and inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. In this study, we observed that GnRH-II (100 nM) induced the activation of p38 MAPK in as early as 10 min, which is in agreement with a previous study performed in OVCAR-3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], while GnRH-I showed weaker and delayed effect than GnRH-II. Furthermore, the activation of p38 MAPK was completely blocked by SB203580 (100 nM), a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, in this study. In addition to this, antiproliferative effect of GnRH was reversed by pretreatment of SB203580 (100 nM). Activation of p38 MAPK can also induce apoptotic cell death, but we did not detect any evidence of apoptosis in HEC1A cells following treatment with GnRH (Data not shown). This result was supported by previous data using HEC1A cells, indicating that GnRH analogs did not affect cell viability after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It can be speculated that effects of Antide, a GnRH receptor antagonist, may have some agonistic or antagonistic effect on the cell proliferation of endometrial cancer cells. Thus, Antide was treated with GnRH or alone for same duration abovementioned in HEC1A cells. In this study, we failed to observe any agonistic or antagonistic effect of Antide on the proliferation of HEC1A cells (data not shown). It was reported that Antide showed an agonistic effect on HEC1A cell proliferation only after 6-day treatment, while no significant antiproliferative effect was observed at earlier times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. This result indicates that Antide may have a lower affinity to GnRH receptors than GnRH analogs. So far, an anti-tumor effect of GnRH analogs has been reported. We speculated that both GnRH-I and -II analogs resulted in an inhibition of human endometrial cancer cell proliferation and this effect is mediated by GnRH receptor and its related signal transduction molecules.</p><p>In summary, both GnRH-I and GnRH-II resulted in a significant increase in integrin &#x003b2;3 expression and evoked the activation of FAK in a time-dependent manner in HEC1A cells. In addition, these analogs induced an activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in a time-dependent manner as downstream pathways of FAK. It appears that GnRH-II has much greater effect on FAK, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK than GnRH-I in these cells. Further, the growth inhibition of HEC1A cells by GnRH-I or GnRH-II may be involved in the activation of integrin-FAK, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. Thus, these results suggest that GnRH may have an effect on the inhibition of cell growth of endometrial cancer cells through a direct pathway. This knowledge could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in the action of GnRH and its biomedical application for the treatment against endometrial cancer. Although this study showed an inhibitory effect of GnRH on endometrial cancer cell growth, a further study is essential to reveal the ultimate cellular change and effect of GnRH on endometrial cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DWP carried out the overall experiments to complete this study and drafted the manuscript.
