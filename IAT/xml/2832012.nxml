Consequently, it was deemed of importance to determine the relevance of both activities of c-Fos in supporting proliferation and growth of tumors: its participation in the formation of AP-1 transcription factors and its phospholipid synthesis activation capacity.

Moreover, no tumor development occurred in NPcis <italic>fos</italic>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice in spite of the fairly conserved levels of AP-1 content in brain tissue from all animals irrespective of their c-Fos content.

Also, compared to non-pathological tissue, human brain tumors evidenced abundant ER-associated c-Fos expression, and more than 2-fold activated phospholipid synthesis.</p><p>Diverse studies have suggested that, as a transcription factor, c-Fos is indispensable for proliferation.

Noteworthy is the observation that in these <italic>fos</italic>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) mice another component of the AP-1 family, Fra-1, rescues c-Fos functions in the growth process when its expression is controlled by the c-Fos promoter but fails to substitute c-Fos in inducing expression of target genes in <italic>fos</italic>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-Fleischmann1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the basic domain of c-Fos (BD that comprises amino acids 139&#x02013;159), which is essential to achieve phospholipid synthesis activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-Gil1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-Crespo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> is highly homologous to the BD of Fra-1, differing only in two conservative amino acid substitutions. This predicts the BD of Fra-1 as capable of activating phospholipid synthesis when Fra-1 is expressed and should, in consequence, support normal growth rates.

However, this is not the case in <italic>fos</italic>(&#x02212;/&#x02212;) animals probably because as in WT mice, only very small overlapping expression patterns of these proteins is observed when each gene is controlled by its own promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-Fleischmann1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the contrary, reports on the pleiotropic changes that necessarily accompany cell growth and proliferation are scarce. Although the elucidation of the molecular mechanism is still in progress, c-Fos is emerging as an inducible protein capable of activating the metabolic machinery of lipid synthesis for membrane biogenesis to accompany growth. Nevertheless, it is clear that not all enzymes of a lipid pathway must be activated to attain an overall lipid activated state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-Crespo1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009544-deArribaZerpa1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Regarding the activation mechanism, two different mechanisms seem at first sight feasible: one is that c-Fos interacts directly with the enzymes that it activates and the other is that c-Fos interacts with other ER components modifying the microenvironment of the enzymes that leads to their activation.
