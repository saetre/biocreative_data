We determined the DNA binding specificity of the Hox11 protein by using a novel technique of random oligonucleotide selection developed in this study. The optimal Hox11 binding sequence, GGCGGTAAGTGG, contained a core TAAGTG motif that is consistent with a prediction based on the residues at specific positions that potentially make DNA base contacts and models of homeodomain-DNA interaction proposed from studies with other homeodomains. The specific interaction between Hox11 and the selected optimal binding sequence was further confirmed by band-shift and DNA competition assays. Given that the Hox11 homeodomain shares low homology with other well studied homeodomains, the presence of a predictable recognition core motif in its optimal binding sequence supports the notion that different homeodomains interact with DNA in a similar manner, through highly conserved residues at specific positions that allow contact with DNA.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0101-a" xlink:role="1931"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0103-a" xlink:role="1933"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0098.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1928"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0099.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1929"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0100.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1930"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1931"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1932"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1933"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1934"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00011-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1935"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
