More specifically, Gro/TLE1 participates in mechanisms that inhibit/delay the differentiation of cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells into neurons during mammalian forebrain development. The anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1 depends on the formation of protein complexes with specific DNA-binding transcription factors that engage Gro/TLE1 through WRP(W/Y) sequences. Interaction with those transcription partners results in Gro/TLE1 recruitment to selected DNA sites and causes increased Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation. The physiological significance of the latter event, termed &#x0201c;cofactor-activated phosphorylation,&#x0201d; had not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed at clarifying the role of cofactor-activated phosphorylation in the anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Principal Findings</title><p>A combination of site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, primary cell culture, and immunocytochemical assays was utilized to characterize point mutations of Ser-286, a residue that is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and is located within the serine/proline-rich (SP) domain of Gro/TLE1. Mutation of Ser-286 to alanine or glutamic acid does not perturb the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with DNA-binding partners, including the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hes1, a prototypical anti-neurogenic WRP(W/Y) motif protein. Ser-286 mutations do not prevent the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to DNA, but they impair cofactor-activated phosphorylation and weaken the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with chromatin. These effects are correlated with an impairment of the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1. Similar results were obtained when mutations of Ser-289 and Ser-298, which are also located within the SP domain of Gro/TLE1, were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the positive correlation between Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation and ability to inhibit cortical neuron differentiation, we propose that hyperphosphorylation induced by cofactor binding plays a positive role in the regulation of Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic activity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) proteins are non-DNA binding transcriptional co-repressors that are recruited to gene regulatory sequences via interaction with a number of DNA-binding proteins.

The mechanisms underlying cofactor-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE proteins, as well as the biological role of this process, were not defined. Previous work has shown that cofactor-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1 is blocked by deletion of the serine/proline-rich (SP) domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Nuthall1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. This domain contains many serine and threonine residues, several of which could be the substrate of phosphorylation. A role for the SP domain in Gro/TLE phosphorylation is in agreement with studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> showing that Gro is phosphorylated within the SP domain at Ser-285 (equivalent to Ser-286 of Gro/TLE1) and Ser-297 (orthologous to Ser-298 of Gro/TLE1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Choi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the possible involvement of those SP domain serine residues in Gro/TLE cofactor-activated phosphorylation as well as the role of the latter modification in Gro/TLE activity remain to be defined.</p><p>Here we describe studies aimed at determining whether the SP domain of Gro/TLE1 is important for cofactor-activated phosphorylation and whether or not the latter has a positive or negative effect on Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic activity. Our results show that Ser-286 within the SP domain of Gro/TLE1 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mutation of Ser-286 into alanine or glutamic acid does not impair Gro/TLE1 ability to interact with anti-neurogenic WRP(W/Y) proteins like Hes1 and become recruited to DNA. However, these mutations abolish Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation, weaken the association of Gro/TLE1 with chromatin, and block its anti-neurogenic activity. Similar effects were observed after mutation of SP domain Ser-289 and Ser-298. Taken together, these findings implicate Ser-286, Ser-289, and Ser-298 in the process of cofactor-activated phosphorylation. They suggest further that this post-translational modification plays a positive role in regulating the ability of Gro/TLE1 to inhibit neuronal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Site Directed Mutagenesis and DNA Plasmids</title><p>DNAs encoding mutated forms of Gro/TLE1 harbouring the mutations S286A, S286E, S289A, S289E, S298A, and S298E were generated by site directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change II site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the <italic>pCMV2-FLAG-Gro/TLE1</italic> plasmid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Nuthall1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> as substrate.

The co-expression of Hes1 led to both cofactor-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1 and the retention of hyperphosphorylated Gro/TLE1 in the chromatin fraction, indicative of a tighter association with chromatin components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008107-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>a, cf. lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, significant amounts of the S286E mutant, which did not undergo cofactor-activated phosphorylation, were recovered in the postnuclear supernatant even in the presence of Hes1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008107-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>a, cf. lanes 7 and 8). Similar results were obtained when mutation S286A was tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008107.s001">Figure S1a</xref>). Mutations S289A, S289E, and S298A also resulted in decreased nuclear retention of Gro/TLE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008107-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>a and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008107.s001">Figure S1a</xref>). These differences were specific because we observed no detectable changes in the subcellular localization of co-transfected Hes1 or endogenous proteins like histone deacetylase 1 or the NF-&#x003ba;B subunit p65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008107-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>, b and c; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008107.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In contrast, mutant S298E, which was competent to undergo cofactor-activated phosphorylation, was mostly retained in the chromatin fraction like wild type Gro/TLE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008107-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>a, cf. lanes 15 and 16).</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the observed differences might be due to perturbations of the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to DNA, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These experiments involve a covalent cross-linking step that &#x02018;immobilizes&#x02019; on chromatin the entire complex of Gro/TLE1 and its DNA-binding partners and other cofactors. As a consequence, the association of Gro/TLE1 with DNA depends only in part on the affinity of Gro/TLE1 for chromatin but mostly on the cross-linking of the entire transcription complex, including the DNA-binding factors to which Gro/TLE1 is bound. We found that wild type and SP domain mutated Gro/TLE1 proteins were all able to become localized <italic>in vivo</italic> to the promoter of the <italic>Ascl1/Mash1 (Ascl1)</italic> gene, a previously characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Ju1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref><italic>bona fide</italic> target of Hes1: Gro/TLE complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008107.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This finding is in agreement with the demonstration that Gro/TLE1 folding and ability to form complexes with Hes1 are not affected by these mutations. Taken together, these results provide evidence that mutations that impair cofactor-activated phosphorylation do not prevent the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to physiologically relevant promoters, but weaken the strength of Gro/TLE1 interaction with chromatin components.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Cofactor-Activated Phosphorylation Is Required for Gro/TLE1 Anti-Neurogenic Activity</title><p>Gro/TLE1 inhibits the differentiation of cortical neurons from undifferentiated progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Nuthall1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Buscarlet2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

The identity of the kinase that might phosphorylate Ser-285/286 of Gro/TLE proteins remains to be determined. Computer-assisted prediction of possible phosphorylation sites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite.mit.edu">http://scansite.mit.edu</ext-link>) suggests glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) as a possible kinase for Gro/TLE1 Ser-286. GSK-3 is normally constitutively active in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Doble1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. This property would make GSK-3 a possible candidate for phosphorylation of target residues that are not always available but become exposed in regulated manners, as is likely the case for Gro/TLE residues that are phosphorylated in response to cofactor binding. GSK-3 has a loose substrate specificity, <bold>S</bold>/<bold>T</bold>-X-X-X-pS/pT, where a proline is often found near the phosphorylated site (highlighted in bold face type). Prior phosphorylation at adjacent residues is often, but not always, a requirement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Doble1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Across Gro/TLE family members, the sequence surrounding Ser-285/286 has a high density of phosphorylatable residues that could contribute to the susceptibility of Ser-285/286 to GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation. Our observation that Ser-289 of Gro/TLE1 is also required for cofactor-activated phosphorylation is consistent with that possibility, although we have not yet obtained evidence that Ser-289 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Regardless of the precise identity of the kinase involved in the phosphorylation of Ser-286, our present results demonstrate an important role for this residue in Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation. Mutation of Ser-286 to either alanine or glutamic acid does not disrupt the ability of Gro/TLE1 to translocate to the nucleus and form functional transcription complexes with DNA-binding proteins, including Hes1. However, mutation of Ser-286 prevents cofactor-activated phosphorylation of Gro/TLE1. One interpretation of these results is that Ser-286 is not critical to the folding and protein-protein interaction ability of Gro/TLE1 but is a target of cofactor-activated phosphorylation. Alternatively, this residue might be phosphorylated independent of cofactor binding, with this phosphorylation needed for subsequent phosphorylation induced by cofactor interaction. We detected Ser-286 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells through mass spectrometric analysis of exogenous Gro/TLE1 without the need for co-transfection of DNA-binding partners such as Hes1. Although this finding might suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-286 is constitutive, it should be noted that HEK293 cells endogenously express Gro/TLE-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Jhas1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, cofactor-activated phosphorylation might have occurred to a certain degree due to the presence of endogenous Gro/TLE-binding transcription factors. Taken together, our present studies provide evidence that Ser-286 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and is required for Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation in response to cofactor binding.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Contribution of SP Domain Ser-289 and Ser-298 to Cofactor-Activated Phosphorylation</title><p>Our studies also identified Ser-289 and Ser-298 of Gro/TLE1 as residues important for cofactor-activated phosphorylation.

However, replacement of Ser-289 with either alanine or glutamic acid completely blocks Gro/TLE1 hyperphosphorylation induced by cofactor binding, as is the case with Ser-286 mutations. This finding suggests that Ser-289 might also be a target of cofactor-activated phosphorylation, if this residue were indeed phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Alternatively, Ser-289 might be needed indirectly for cofactor-activated phosphorylation to occur, possibly at Ser-286.</p><p>Somewhat different results were obtained when the role of Ser-298 was examined. We observed that the S298A mutation causes a reduced, but still detectable, change in Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation in response to cofactor binding. In contrast, the S298E mutation does not perturb this process to a detectable extent. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ser-298 might be phosphorylated, but not as a direct target of cofactor-activated phosphorylation. Instead, phosphorylation of Ser-298 might be a contributing, but not essential, event to the latter. Optimal cofactor-activated phosphorylation might be achieved when Ser-298 is phosphorylated, a situation that could be mimicked by a serine-to-glutamic acid substitution. Alternatively, Ser-298 phosphorylation might be a parallel, additive event that could occur in response to cofactor binding but also independent of the latter. We found no evidence that the S298E mutant migrated more slowly than wild type Gro/TLE1 in the absence of exogenous cofactor. This situation suggests that this mutation does not cause a constitutive hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-298 is not alone sufficient to activate a process like cofactor-activated phosphorylation.</p><p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested that Gro Ser-297 is phosphorylated by <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (DHIPK2), a nuclear Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates a variety of transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Rinaldo1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it remains to be determined whether or not HIPK2 phosphorylates Ser-297/298 of insect and vertebrate Gro/TLE proteins. This ambiguity derives from the fact that studies suggesting DHIPK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-297 of Gro were based on the use of a multiple point mutant in which Ser-297 was mutated together with Ser-194, Ser-196, Ser-285, and Ser-287 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Choi1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, Ser-297/298 is not followed by a proline residue, as is the case with most characterized HIPK2 substrates.

In summary, the analysis of mutations of Ser-289 and Ser-298 show that these residues are also important for the ability of Gro/TLE1 to undergo cofactor-activated phosphorylation, although it remains to be determined whether or not they represent sites of <italic>in vivo</italic> phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Impairment of Gro/TLE1 Cofactor-Activated Phosphorylation Is Correlated with a Weakened Ability to Associate with Chromatin</title><p>In addition to presenting evidence that Ser-286 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, our studies also showed that the mutations S286A and S286E do not perturb the nuclear translocation, interaction with DNA-binding proteins, and recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to chromatin. However, these mutations both impair cofactor activated phosphorylation and weaken the strength of Gro/TLE1 association with chromatin. It is worth mentioning that the findings that mutations of Ser-286 do not detectably alter the localization of Gro/TLE1 to chromatin but weaken the strength of its association with the latter are only apparently contradictory. The covalent cross-linking step that is part of the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used to determine association with specific promoters links the entire complex of Gro/TLE1 and its DNA-binding partners (e.g., Hes1) to chromatin. As a result, the association of the Gro/TLE1: Hes1 complex with DNA depends on the cross-linking to chromatin of the entire complex, including DNA-bound Hes1 and other components of the complex, and not just on the affinity of Gro/TLE1 for chromatin. This is not the case in subcellular fractionation assays that are performed in the absence of any cross-linking agent and thus can reveal changes in affinity for chromatin.</p><p>The finding that Ser-286 mutations weaken the chromatin association of Gro/TLE1 is consistent with the demonstration that pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase CK2-mediated phosphorylation, which occurs constitutively and is required for cofactor-activated phosphorylation, also weakens the association of Gro/TLE1 with subnuclear structures like chromatin and, possibly, the nuclear matrix (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Nuthall1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Nuthall2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008107-Javed1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>).

In contrast, the S298E mutant, which undergoes an apparently normal cofactor-activated phosphorylation, has an intact anti-neurogenic ability. These results provide evidence that the change in Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation associated with cofactor binding is a positive mechanism that is required for the ability of Gro/TLE1 to inhibit neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Taken together, the present findings suggest that cofactor-activated phosphorylation is required for the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1, and possibly for some of its other functions, by bringing changes in Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation that are correlated with the establishment of functional &#x02018;repressosomes&#x02019; where Gro/TLE1 is in a complex with the appropriate transcription repression partners and forms stable interactions with transcriptionally relevant chromatin structures. In turn, this would result in optimal Gro/TLE-mediated transcription repression activity, possibly via chromatin remodelling mechanisms. This model might explain why disruption of cofactor-activated phosphorylation impairs the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1, which involves regulation of endogenous promoter/enhancer elements, but does not detectably perturb Gro/TLE1-mediated transcriptional repression of exogenous reporter genes, which are unlikely to acquire a true chromatin-like structure in transfected cells. In the context of transiently transfected cells, Gro/TLE1 may be able to repress transcription via inhibition of the RNA polymerase complex, independent of its ability to modify chromatin structure.

It is possible that Gro/TLE proteins are activated by cofactor binding and the ensuing changes in phosphorylation, and that their activity persists until regulated phosphorylation mediated by HIPK2 and/or MAPK acts as a switch to stop Gro/TLE-mediated functions. This negative effect could be caused by weakening the interaction of Gro/TLE with chromatin and/or their transcriptional partners, or by changes in Gro/TLE stability and/or sub-nuclear distribution, ultimately resulting in weakened/blocked transcriptional repression. Future investigations will be aimed at testing these and other possibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008107.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Analysis of the chromatin association of Gro/TLE1 by subcellular fractionation.
