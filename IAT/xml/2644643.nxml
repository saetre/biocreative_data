We investigated whether the mutant protein alters mitochondrial function. We found that constitutive and doxycycline-induced expression of the mutant AR in MN-1 and PC12 cells, respectively, are associated with depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. This was mitigated by cyclosporine A, which inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. We also found that the expression of the mutant protein in the presence of ligand results in an elevated level of reactive oxygen species, which is blocked by the treatment with the antioxidants co-enzyme Q10 and idebenone. The mutant protein in MN-1 cells also resulted in increased Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3. We assessed the effects of mutant AR on the transcription of mitochondrial proteins and found altered expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; coactivator 1 and the mitochondrial specific antioxidant superoxide dismutase-2 in affected tissues of SBMA knock-in mice. In addition, we found that the AR associates with mitochondria in cultured cells. This study thus provides evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA cell and animal models, either through indirect effects on the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes or through direct effects of the mutant protein on mitochondria or both. These findings indicate possible benefit from mitochondrial therapy for SBMA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) results from the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C1">1</xref>). SBMA is one of at least nine diseases with polyglutamine expansion, including Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral&#x02013;pallidoluysian atrophy and six spinocerebellar ataxias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C2">2</xref>). SBMA is X-linked and fully affects only males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C1">1</xref>). The polyglutamine expansion in the AR results in selective degeneration of motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C4">4</xref>). The clinical characteristics of SBMA include muscle cramps, slowly progressive extremity weakness, muscle atrophy, fasciculations, dysphagia and signs of androgen insensitivity, such as gynecomastia and reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C5">5</xref>).</p><p>The AR is a member of the nuclear receptor family and a ligand-activated transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C6">6</xref>). In its inactive state, the AR is cytoplasmic and sequestered by heat shock proteins. On ligand binding, it dissociates from the complex of heat shock proteins and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to specific DNA sequences and activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C6">6</xref>). The polyglutamine expansion in the AR likely confers a toxic gain and also a partial loss of AR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C8">8</xref>). Aberrant interactions of the mutant AR with other proteins, including transcriptional co-activators, result in transcriptional dysregulation and neuronal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C10">10</xref>). There is considerable evidence supporting ligand-dependent toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C15">15</xref>). For example, reducing androgen levels in transgenic mice rescues the motor impairment and increases survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C14">14</xref>). These studies point to altered transcriptional regulation as a disease mechanism, but they do not preclude the possibility of toxicity in the cytoplasmic compartment. The specific mechanism of SBMA remains unclear, and there is currently no effective treatment.</p><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Friedreich's ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C21">21</xref>). It is also known that transcriptional dysregulation in the nucleus can affect mitochondrial turnover and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C24">24</xref>). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator-1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;) and its homolog, PGC-1&#x003b2;, are nuclear transcriptional co-activators and important regulators of energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C26">26</xref>). Recent studies in HD show altered PGC-1&#x003b1; to be a likely link between transcriptional dysregulation and mitochondrial defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C28">28</xref>). Currently, little is known about mitochondrial involvement in SBMA. Previous studies in cell models suggest alterations in mitochondrial distribution and sequestration of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins in mutant AR aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C30">30</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated whether mutant AR alters mitochondrial function in models of SBMA. We found that the expression of mutant AR in motor neuron-derived (MN-1) cells and with doxycycline induction in pheochromacytoma-derived (PC12) cells is associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cyclosporine A (CsA) mitigates the membrane depolarization, and the increase in ROS levels is blocked by the antioxidants co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and idebenone. We also found that the mutant AR increases Bax protein levels, and activates caspases 9 and 3. The activation of caspases 9 and 3 is likely mediated by the mitochondrial transition pore. Moreover, we observed decreased levels of PGC-1&#x003b2; and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in MN-1 cells and in the tissues of a knock-in mouse model of SBMA. We also found <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for association of AR with mitochondria. At the ultrastructural level, this association is greater with the AR containing the expanded repeat. Taken together, our results implicate mitochondrial abnormalities and redox imbalance in SBMA. This study provides evidence that mitochondrial modulators and antioxidants may have therapeutic value in SBMA.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Mutant AR activates the mitochondrial caspase pathway</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the expression of mutant AR results in the activation of caspase 3 in motor neuron-like cells (MN-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C34">34</xref>). To investigate whether caspase 9, a mediator of the mitochondrial caspase pathway and activator of caspase 3, is also involved in SBMA pathogenesis, we used MN-1 cells that stably express either normal (AR-24Q) or mutant AR (AR-65Q) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C35">35</xref>). We found that the ligand exposure increases caspase 9 activity by 50 &#x000b1; 12% in AR-65Q cells compared to AR-24Q cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>A). Opening of the mitochondrial transition pore (MTP) is involved in the activation of caspase 9, and CsA inhibits opening of the MTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C36">36</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the caspase 9 activation observed in MN-1 cells expressing mutant AR could be decreased by CsA. We found that the ligand-induced increase in caspase 9 activity in AR-65Q cells is decreased by 32 &#x000b1; 8% by treatment of the cells with CsA (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>A). As a positive control for caspase 9 inhibition, we used the specific caspase 9 inhibitor Ac-LEHD-CHO. Next, we asked whether caspase 9 is upstream of caspase 3 in MN-1 cells expressing mutant AR. Although in this cell model of SBMA caspase-3 activation is not ligand-dependent, it is polyglutamine-dependent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>B), which is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C31">31</xref>). Treatment of cells with another caspase 9 inhibitor z-LEHD-FMK blocked the increase in caspase 3 activity by 47%, indicating that the activation of caspase 3 is at least in part due to caspase 9 activation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>B). To further test the hypothesis that the mitochondrial caspase pathway is involved in SBMA, we examined whether inhibiting the MTP abrogates caspase 3 activation using a fluorescent-based assay (MitoCasp). As a positive control for this assay, we used staurosporine, an apoptotic inducer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddn310/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). We found that the increase of 29 &#x000b1; 4% (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) in caspase 3 activity observed in the AR-65Q cells relative to the AR-24Q cells was blocked by treating the cells with CsA (39 &#x000b1; 7%; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.01) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>C).</p><fig id="DDN310F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Mutant AR activates the mitochondrial caspase pathway. (<bold>A</bold>) MN-1 cells expressing the normal and mutant AR were exposed to vehicle alone or androgen ligand (R1881), with and without caspase 9 inhibitor (Ac-LEHD) or CsA. The AR-65Q cells had an increase in caspase 9 activity in the presence of R1881. CsA and the caspase 9 inhibitor block this increase. (<bold>B</bold>) Caspase 3 activity was measured with a fluorometric assay in the AR-24Q and AR-65Q MN-1 cells. These cells were treated with vehicle alone, caspase 9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-FMK) or pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD). AR-65Q cells showed a ligand-independent increase in caspase 3 activity. This increase is partially blocked by z-LEHD-FMK. (<bold>C</bold>) We measured caspase 3 activity with another fluorometric assay in MN-1 cells expressing AR-24Q and AR-65Q cells. The cells were treated with either vehicle or CsA. There was an increase in caspase 3 activity in cells expressing the mutant AR. This increase is ligand-independent and partially blocked with CsA. The caspase activities are indicated as percent activity relative to untreated AR-24Q (assigned as 100%) and normalized to total protein content.

Therefore, we tested whether the expression of these markers of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis is altered in MN-1 cells expressing mutant AR. We found that the expression of expanded polyglutamine AR in MN-1 cells increased the levels of Bax protein by 15 &#x000b1; 3% (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>D). We did not detect any change in cytochrome C release (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>E). As control for Bax levels and release of cytochrome C, we used lysates of HeLa cells treated with staurosporine (data not shown). It has previously been shown that the pro-apoptotic protein Bad when phosphorylated remains inactive and sequestered in the cytoplasm by the transcription factor, 14-3-3. Upon the activation of the calcineurin pathway, Bad is dephosphorylated and translocates to the mitochondria where it inactivates the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL and then activates caspase 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C41">41</xref>). To test whether Bad is activated in MN-1 cells expressing mutant AR, we did immunoblotting in MN-1 total cell extracts for phospho-Bad (Ser 136) and total Bad (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F1">1</xref>F). We found no difference in phosphorylated Bad in AR-65Q cells compared to AR-24Q cells. Taken together, these results indicate that mutant AR increases Bax levels and activates the mitochondrial caspase pathway independently of cytochrome C release and dephosphorylation of Bad.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Mitochondrial mass and number are reduced in cells expressing mutant AR</title><p>We next sought to determine whether cells expressing mutant AR have mitochondrial abnormalities.

We used a mitochondria specific fluorescent dye, MitoTracker Green FM, to examine mitochondrial mass by flow cytometry. This dye localizes to mitochondria independent of the functional state.

To investigate whether the activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway and reduced number of mitochondria observed in the AR-65Q cells are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, we examined the MtMP in MN-1 cells.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) are two nuclear-encoded genes regulated by PGC-1.

Tfam in turn regulates transcription of genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA, including subunits of complexes of the electron transport chain. We examined mRNA levels for the mitochondrial proteins NADH dehydrogenase 1 and 5 (ND1 and ND5), which are subunits of complex I, and cytochrome c oxidase I, II and III (COX I, II and III), which are subunits of complex IV. ND1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased (64 &#x000b1; 13%; <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) in AR-65Q cells exposed to ligand, while expression of ND5, COX I, II and III was unaltered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F5">5</xref>A). To further assess whether the transcription of genes involved in redox balance is affected in the ligand-exposed AR-65Q cells, we examined the transcript levels of antioxidant genes.

Here we studied mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA. We found that the expression of mutant AR is associated with activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway, decreased MtMP, elevated ROS levels and increased cell death. These changes were mitigated with CsA and antioxidants. We also report consistent decreases in PGC-1&#x003b2; mRNA and in SOD2 mRNA and protein. Altered gene expression in a knock-in mouse model of SBMA was evident in pre-manifesting mice, suggesting that mitochondrial abnormalities and redox imbalance occur early in the disease mechanism. Interestingly, we found AR associated with the mitochondria in MN-1 and PC12 cells. Taken together, the evidence supports both indirect and direct effects of mutant AR on mitochondrial function in SBMA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDN310F8">8</xref>).</p><fig id="DDN310F8" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;8.</label><caption><p>Mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA. Mitochondrial mass, number and membrane potential are likely affected by mutant AR indirectly through ligand-dependent alterations in mitochondrial gene expression and directly through association of AR with mitochondria. The decrease in MtMP is blocked by CsA. Downstream from the mitochondrial dysfunction, mutant AR increases ROS levels, which can reversibly result in further deleterious effects on the mitochondrial membrane. The antioxidants CoQ10 and idebenone block the increase in ROS levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction increases caspase 9 activity, which in turn increases caspase 3 activity. Elevated ROS levels and caspase 3 activation result in cell death. Activation of the caspases is mitigated by CsA, and cell death is attenuated by CsA, CoQ10, idebenone and the caspase inhibitor, z-VAD. Thus, regardless of the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction, downstream events may be targets for therapeutic intervention, for example with CsA and antioxidants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddn31008"/></fig><p>SBMA is characterized by both a loss of normal AR function and a toxic gain of function. It is well established that there is transcriptional dysregulation due to partial loss of AR function and to ligand-dependent toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C14">14</xref>). The effects of mutant AR on mitochondrial function that we found were both ligand-dependent and -independent. Although previous studies identified gene expression changes in the presence of mutant AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C52">52</xref>), transcriptional effects on either nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes or transcription of the mitochondrial DNA have not previously been reported. It is likely that mutant AR alters the expression of mitochondrial genes, and this in turn may affect mitochondrial turnover and respiratory function. The nuclear co-activator, PGC-1, is known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C53">53</xref>). PGC-1&#x003b1; knock-out mice have impaired energy homeostasis, hyperactivity, striatal degeneration and behavioral changes characteristic of movement disorders, including HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C54">54</xref>). PGC-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; regulate oxidant-detoxifying enzymes and also the expression of mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), a direct regulator of mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C55">55</xref>). We could not detect the expression of PGC-1&#x003b1; in MN-1 cells, but transcript levels of its isoform PGC-1&#x003b2; and Tfam were significantly decreased, and this could account for the reduced mitochondrial number and membrane potential that we observed. In addition, expression of cellular antioxidants, such as SOD2, was altered in MN-1 cells, consistent with increased oxidative stress. In pre-manifesting (1 month old) SBMA knock-in mice, we found alterations in transcripts that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1&#x003b1;, PGC-1&#x003b2; and Tfam), metabolism (subunits of complex I and IV that are encoded by the mitochondrial DNA) and antioxidants. This indicates that mitochondrial alterations and oxidative imbalance are early and important events in SBMA. It is also noteworthy that the transcript levels of ND1 and ND5 are decreased concurrent with decreased PGC-1&#x003b2; and Tfam in the manifesting (5 month old) SBMA mice. This suggests that the metabolic demand increases in the tissues of this mouse model as the disease progresses. Also, consistent with the previously reported pathological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C57">57</xref>), the greatest changes occurred in muscle and testis early in the disease and persisted as the disease progressed. Future investigations are warranted to examine whether mutant AR alters bioenergetics and whether it does so by indirectly or directly affecting the activity of the electron transport chain and ATP levels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown the localization of steroid and thyroid hormone receptors to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C61">61</xref>). Hormone response elements in the mitochondrial genome and metabolic effects of glucocorticoids and estrogens suggest a direct action of these hormones on mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C62">62</xref>). We are unaware of previous reports of normal or mutated AR localized to neuronal mitochondria. We found mitochondria-associated AR in MN-1 cells, which have constitutive expression of AR, and also in the inducible PC12 cells that express normal and mutant AR at comparable levels. This supports the conclusion that the association is not simply due to clonal variation or differences in the relative levels of AR expression. Although the association of AR with mitochondria that we found is not limited to the mutant form, it is likely that the presence of the expanded polyglutamine-containing AR directly confers a toxic gain of function resulting in mitochondrial abnormalities and oxidative imbalance. These results suggest that the mitochondrial defects may be due to both transcriptional events mediated by the nucleus and a direct toxic effect of the mutant AR on the mitochondria. The mutant proteins that cause HD and spinocerebellar ataxia 3 have also been reported to associate with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C63">63</xref>) suggesting that the mitochondrial association of the mutant proteins in polyglutamine expansion diseases may point towards a common pathogenic mechanism. Our finding that AR localizes to mitochondria in both MN-1 and PC12 cells may have important implications in understanding normal AR function and its role in disease.</p><p>It has not previously been well documented that mutant AR affects mitochondrial number and function. However, it has been reported in other neurological disorders that excitotoxicity and other insults cause mitochondria to undergo vesiculation of the cristae, vacuolation and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C66">66</xref>). Although in our study we cannot definitively demonstrate fragmentation, our results do indicate that the expanded polyglutamine in AR alters mitochondrial number and morphology of the cristae. The reduced number of mitochondria in PC12 cells induced to express mutant AR indicates that the decrease in MN-1 cells is not simply an adaptive change related to constitutive expression of the mutant protein. Mitochondrial number can be affected by differences in cellular proliferation or passage numbers of the clones. However, the different experimental conditions did not induce any variation in cellular proliferation, and we controlled for possible differences due to different passage numbers of the different clones. The vesiculation and vacuolation that we observed in the AR-65Q cells could be due to mitochondrial toxicity or vice versa. The mitochondrial membrane depolarization and the response to CsA treatment in the <italic>in vitro</italic> models of SBMA are further evidence for the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and the MTP in SBMA. The protective effect of CsA suggests but does not prove the involvement of the MTP, because CsA also has other effects, such as calcineurin inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C67">67</xref>). The effects we found on MtMP were both ligand-dependent and -independent. In light of these results, the effects of the mutant AR on mitochondrial mass, number and membrane potential may be due either to indirect nuclear-encoded transcriptional effects on mitochondria or to direct toxic interactions of the expanded polyglutamine with mitochondria. However, these are not mutually exclusive, as the disease mechanism could involve a combination of both effects.</p><p>Regardless of the cause of mitochondrial dysfunction, we found that the effects of the mutant AR include increased ROS, increased Bax protein levels, activation of caspases 9 and 3 and increased cell death. The mitochondrial abnormalities described in this study may be an important modifier of the pathogenic process, where the ligand-dependent effect of the mutant AR on transcription is likely to be exacerbated by a direct effect on mitochondria. The mitochondrial dysfunction may then tip the cell towards the activation of the caspase cascade and death. Alterations in oxidative phosphorylation may result in the generation of ROS and elevated oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C68">68</xref>). Also, increased ROS generation may further damage mitochondria. <italic>In vivo</italic> deletion of SOD2 in mice results in mitochondrial pathology and shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C69">69</xref>). In another study, partial reduction of SOD2 in hAPP transgenic mice accelerates the onset of &#x003b2; amyloid-induced behavioral impairment and significantly worsens Alzheimer's disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C70">70</xref>). We did not see a general decrease in transcript levels of cellular antioxidants, but the mitochondrial antioxidant, SOD2, was specifically and consistently reduced in all three affected tissues, indicating the importance of mitochondria-associated oxidative stress in SBMA. This oxidative imbalance can further result in mitochondrial membrane changes that initiate the intrinsic caspase cascade involving activation of caspases 9 and 3. Our results support cytochrome C release- and Bad-independent activation of caspase 9, consistent with previous reports of cytochrome C independent activation of caspase 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C71">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C74">74</xref>). In addition our findings that the increase in Bax and caspase 3 activation is polyglutamine-dependent while caspase 9 activation is ligand-dependent also suggest involvement of other pathways in the activation of caspase 9. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or the release of Smac/Diablo can mediate caspase 9 activation. Further studies of these pathways in cell culture and mouse tissues may be warranted. The finding that CsA mitigates MtMP changes and the activation of caspases 9 and 3 indicates that the expression of the mutant AR is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which can be reversed by pharmacological intervention. Importantly, treating these cells with antioxidants was effective not only in mitigating the increase in ROS but also in blocking cell death caused by the expression of mutant AR. While cell death in the MN-1 cells was dependent on mutant polyglutamine but not ligand, the toxicity of mutant AR in PC12 cells was ligand-dependent. With constitutive expression of AR-65Q, the mutant MN-1 clone may have adapted to cope with ligand-dependent effects. These <italic>in vitro</italic> studies warrant follow-up studies in tissue mitochondria and pre-clinical therapeutic studies of antioxidants in SBMA mouse models.</p><p>While we do not differentiate between primary and secondary roles of mitochondrial defects in SBMA pathogenesis, we propose that mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulation of the antioxidant defense are important in the disease mechanism. Given the central role of mitochondrial integrity in bioenergetics and cell death pathways, improvement of mitochondrial function is worth considering as a therapeutic approach to SBMA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents</title><p>All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Gaithersburg, MD) unless otherwise mentioned.

This distance was approximated based on the lengths of two &#x0223c;15 nm long IgG molecules separating the gold and the antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C80">80</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Cell death assays</title><p>We used a flow cytometry-based cell death assay as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDN310C81">81</xref>).

Except for staurosporine (4 h) and antimycin (16 h) treatments, the rest of the treatments were for 48 h. The cells were then trypsinized, gently pelleted and re-suspended in 1 ml of 1X PBS. The suspensions were then stained with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) immediately before flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur). For each sample, 80 000 non-gated events were acquired. PI fluorescence was analyzed in the FL-3 channel in dot and density blot formats. The results were expressed as a percentage of PI-positive dead cells divided by the total number of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4m"><title>Statistics</title><p>All experiments were conducted at least twice with each condition in triplicate.
