Within this promoter are 10 potential binding sites for the a1-&#x003b1;2 heterodimer, which represses <italic>HO</italic> and other haploid-specific genes in diploid yeast cells. We have determined that a1-&#x003b1;2 binds to these sites with differing affinity, and that while certain strong-affinity sites are crucial for repression of <italic>HO</italic>, some of the weak-affinity sites are dispensable. However, these weak-affinity a1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites are strongly conserved in related yeast species and have a role in maintaining repression upon the loss of strong-affinity sites. We found that these weak sites are sufficient for a1-&#x003b1;2 to partially repress <italic>HO</italic> and recruit the Tup1-Cyc8 (Tup1-Ssn6) co-repressor complex to the <italic>HO</italic> promoter. We demonstrate that the Swi5 activator protein is not bound to URS1 in diploid cells, suggesting that recruitment of the Tup1-Cyc8 complex by a1-&#x003b1;2 prevents DNA binding by activator proteins resulting in repression of <italic>HO</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Regulation of transcription in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> often occurs through relatively simple sets of promoter elements, usually located within a few hundred bases upstream of the transcription start site. In contrast to most yeast promoters, the <italic>HO</italic> gene is regulated by an atypically large, modular promoter containing an extensive array of binding sites for transcriptional regulators, which is similar to the promoters of higher eukaryotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c5">5</xref>). Activation of <italic>HO</italic> transcription proceeds through an ordered recruitment of transcription factors to its promoter, which is initiated by a complex formed by two sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, Swi5 and Pho2. <italic>SWI5</italic> encodes a Zinc-finger protein that is sequestered in the cytoplasm until late anaphase, when it enters the nucleus and activates the transcription of several genes before being rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c7">7</xref>). The Swi5&#x02013;Pho2 complex binds to two sites at the distal end of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter, known as URS1 (Upstream Regulatory Sequence 1, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c8">8</xref>). Upon binding to URS1, Swi5 recruits both the SWI&#x0002f;SNF chromatin remodeling complex and the Srb&#x0002f;Mediator (SRB&#x0002f;MED) complex to URS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c9">9</xref>). The recruitment of these co-activator complexes to URS1 is followed by the degradation of Swi5 and the stepwise appearance at URS2 of the SAGA complex, Swi4&#x0002f;Swi6 and SRB&#x0002f;MED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c9">9</xref>). This results in the recruitment of SRB&#x0002f;MED and RNA Polymerase II, in two distinct steps, to the <italic>HO</italic> TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c10">10</xref>) and subsequent <italic>HO</italic> transcription at the G1&#x0002f;S stage of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c3">3</xref>). Expression of <italic>HO</italic> leads to a switch in mating type that is initiated by the HO endonuclease, which cleaves a specific DNA sequence at the <italic>MAT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c11">11</xref>).</p><p>In addition to being expressed at a specific point in the cell cycle, <italic>HO</italic> transcription is restricted to the mother cells from a cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c4">4</xref>). Expression of <italic>HO</italic> is repressed in daughter cells by Ash1, whose mRNA is asymmetrically localized to daughter cells during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c14">14</xref>). Repression of <italic>HO</italic> in haploid daughters prevents mating-type switching in these cells. This allows for conjugation with its haploid mother cell that has switched mating type, forming a diploid cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c15">15</xref>). In heterozygous diploid <italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold>&#x0002f;<italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> cells, transcription of <italic>HO</italic> is repressed by the MAT&#x003b1;2 and MAT<bold>a</bold>1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c16">16</xref>). This prevents switching of one of the <italic>MAT</italic> loci, and the subsequent formation of homozygous diploids (<italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold>&#x0002f;<italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold> or <italic>MAT&#x003b1;&#x0002f;MAT&#x003b1;</italic>). Such homozygous diploids cannot sporulate, yet are still able to mate with a haploid cell to form a heterozygous triploid cell, which would have problems such as chromosomal non-disjunction during meiosis. Repression of <italic>HO</italic> in heterozygous diploid cells is thereby an important process by which yeasts maintain three stable cell types: two haploid mating types and a non-mating heterozygous diploid.</p><p>The MAT&#x003b1;2 and MAT<bold>a</bold>1 proteins (hereafter referred to as &#x003b1;2 and <bold>a</bold>1, respectively) each contain a homeodomain, a DNA-binding motif that is conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c17">17</xref>). &#x003b1;2 and <bold>a</bold>1 form a heterodimer (<bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2) that cooperatively binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c18">18</xref>). The <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 heterodimer represses several haploid-specific genes, including <italic>HO</italic>, in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c19">19</xref>). &#x003b1;2 also associates with another cofactor, Mcm1, to form a complex in haploid <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> and diploid cells that represses mating-type <bold>a</bold>-specific genes, such as <italic>STE6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c19">19</xref>). The <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;2-Mcm1 complexes repress transcription by the recruitment of the Tup1-Cyc8 (also known as Tup1-Ssn6) co-repressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c21">21</xref>), which has been shown to negatively regulate several functionally diverse sets of genes in yeast and have conserved homologs in higher order eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c22">22</xref>). Tup1-Cyc8 has been proposed to repress transcription through two mechanisms: (i) inhibitory interaction with SRB&#x0002f;MED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c27">27</xref>) and (ii) the creation of a repressive chromatin environment through nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c29">29</xref>) and co-recruitment of histone deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c31">31</xref>).</p><p>Sequence analysis of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter revealed 10 elements that shared similarity to known <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites from the <italic>MAT&#x003b1;1</italic> and <italic>STE5</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c2">2</xref>). Comparison of these elements to the <italic>MAT&#x003b1;1</italic> and <italic>STE5</italic><bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c2">2</xref>), along with mutational analysis of a consensus <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>), predicted that some of the sites may be strong-affinity sites, while others may only be weakly bound, if at all. These predictions raise the question of whether these weaker sites are bound by the <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 heterodimer <italic>in vivo</italic>, and if they have a functional role in the cell. Our results demonstrate that the 10 <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding sites of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter exhibit varying degrees of binding affinity and repression on their own. Some of these weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites are strongly conserved among related yeasts and appear to play an auxiliary role to stronger affinity sites within the context of the genomic <italic>HO</italic> promoter. These findings illustrate how promoter architecture and the use of sites of varying affinities may be important regulators of transcriptional repression in the complex promoters of higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Heterologous <italic>CYC1-lacZ</italic> transcription reporter plasmids were made by inserting annealed oligonucleotides bearing an <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site with 5&#x02032;-TCGA overhangs into the SalI site of pAV73 (2 &#x003bc; <italic>URA3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c33">33</xref>). pYJ103, a pAV73-based <italic>lacZ</italic> transcription reporter containing the consensus <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site, and pJM130, a <italic>CEN LEU2</italic> plasmid bearing <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic>, have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c34">34</xref>).</p><p>pG333, bearing the <italic>HO</italic> open reading frame (ORF) and 4 kb of upstream non-coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c35">35</xref>), was digested with MfeI and SapI, followed by Klenow fill-in and re-ligation to yield pJR067. The 734 bp SacI&#x02013;BamHI fragment of pJR067 was subcloned into a derivative of pUC19 (which had been digested with HindIII and XbaI, the ends made blunt with Klenow polymerase and re-ligated to yield pJR081), yielding pJR082.

The mutations introduced at these <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites substitute both the T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>18</sub> bases (as numbered in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>B) to guanosine, as mutation of either <bold>a</bold>1 or &#x003b1;2 half-site in this manner has been shown to prevent <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>). Note that in the case of the HO(8) site, only the T<sub>18</sub>G mutation was constructed, as position 6 of the HO(8) site is cytosine, a base that has been shown to fully derepress transcription when at the corresponding position in an <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 consensus site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>). Multiple mutations were created by subcloning the SacI&#x0002f;SphI and SphI&#x0002f;BamHI fragments within pJR082-based plasmids, then subcloning the SacI&#x0002f;BamHI fragments from these plasmids into pJR067 and its derivatives.

The background probability of the average alignment scores was calculated by a similar analysis on two other regions of the genome, a region 2000&#x02013;3000 bp upstream of <italic>HO</italic> and a region spanning positions 81213&#x02013;83471 on chromosome IV which is 800 bp from the nearest annotated gene.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Analysis of isolated a1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter</title><p>To assess the relative strengths of each of the 10 predicted <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites found in the <italic>HO</italic> promoter, each individual site was cloned between the UAS<italic><sub>CYC1</sub></italic> and TATA box of a plasmid-based <italic>CYC1-lacZ</italic> reporter.

The remaining sites demonstrate considerably weaker levels of repression, from nearly non-functional [HO(8) and HO(1)] to moderate strength [HO(7), HO(5) and HO(2)] when compared with a reporter plasmid lacking an <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site.</p><p>To assess whether the levels of repression correlate with <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 DNA-binding affinity <italic>in vitro</italic>, the four <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites from URS1 were used as probes for EMSAs using purified &#x003b1;2 and <bold>a</bold>1 proteins.

One approach to address this question is to determine whether these sites are conserved in related yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c47">47</xref>).

The average alignment scores for these sites were compared against the distribution of scores generated by the same analysis of two other non-ORF regions in the genome. The resulting distribution of scores for both the <italic>HO</italic> promoter and the other regions fits an exponential function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f3">3</xref>). The average scores of many of the <italic>HO</italic> sites are in the tail of the distribution and 7 of the 10 <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites appeared to be well conserved among the different species. As might be expected, several of the strong-repressor sites, such as HO(3), HO(4) and HO(10), are highly conserved among the different species and have high scores in the analysis. In contrast, HO(1) and HO(2), which were weak repressor sites on their own, showed significantly lower values in the analysis. In addition, the conservation of the HO(5) site, which is also a weak repressor site on its own, is borderline, with a 2.4% significance. Interestingly, the two other weak repressor sites, HO(7) and HO(8), are strongly conserved among the different yeasts. In fact, these sites appear to be more highly conserved than HO(4), HO(6) and HO(9), which are all strong <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 repressor sites. The fact that HO(7) and HO(8) are highly conserved strongly suggests that they have a functional role in regulating the <italic>HO</italic> promoter, even though they only weakly function on their own.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of a1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites within the intact <italic>HO</italic> promoter</title><p>The presence of conserved weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites within URS1 led to the question of their contribution to repression of <italic>HO</italic>. We therefore constructed integrated mutant versions of each of the <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites of URS1 within the context of the full <italic>HO</italic> promoter. The mutations introduced at these <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites substituted key bases that are absolutely required for DNA binding by &#x003b1;2 and <bold>a</bold>1 (T<sub>6</sub>G and T<sub>18</sub>G mutations, respectively, as numbered in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>). These mutations disrupt the Asn51-adenine contact demonstrated by all homeodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c17">17</xref>), and each mutation on its own has been shown to completely abrogate repression by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 when introduced into a consensus <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>). Mutant sites were integrated into the genome at the <italic>HO</italic> locus of haploid <italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold> and <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> strains by homologous recombination. All of the mutant haploid strains expressed <italic>HO</italic> mRNA at levels comparable to the wild-type haploid strains, indicating that the mutations in the <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites did not affect the <italic>HO</italic> expression (data not shown). Haploid strains were then mated to form diploid strains that were then assayed for the expression of <italic>HO</italic> mRNA by S1 nuclease digestion.</p><p>We first examined the effect of mutation of the strong <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites HO(10) and HO(9) within the context of the full <italic>HO</italic> promoter. Mutation of these sites, alone or in combination, did not derepress <italic>HO</italic> transcription in diploid cells, presumably due to several strong <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites within URS2 (data not shown). We therefore constructed the same <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site mutants in the context of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter with a large portion of URS2 deleted, as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>A. This deletion of URS2 leaves intact one Swi4&#x0002f;Swi6 binding site and the HO(1) <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 site, the latter of which was demonstrated to be nearly non-functional on its own (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f2">2</xref>A). With URS2 deleted, <italic>HO</italic> is expressed in haploid strains at the same levels as with the wild-type promoter, and completely repressed in the diploid state (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>) (data not shown). Mutation of either HO(10) or HO(9) in this context caused slight, but significant, derepression of <italic>HO</italic> transcription in diploid cells. Furthermore, mutation of both sites caused an increase in <italic>HO</italic> mRNA in comparison with either single mutant. The level of <italic>HO</italic> expression seen in the HO(10)&#x0002f;HO(9) double mutant was not as high as observed in haploid cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>, compare lane 8 with lanes 1 and 2), which suggested that the weaker sites of URS1, HO(8) and HO(7) contribute to <italic>HO</italic> repression. Mutation of either of these sites on their own caused no observable derepression of <italic>HO</italic> transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>, lanes 6 and 7), and mutation of both had no further effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>A, lane 3). The HO(8) and HO(7) mutations had little effect in combination with the HO(10) mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>, compare lane 4 with lanes 9 and 10), and the HO(8) mutation did not have a significant effect in combination with the HO(9) mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>, compare lane 5 with lane 11). However, the HO(9)&#x0002f;HO(7) double mutation shows a significant increase in the production of <italic>HO</italic> mRNA, to a level even greater than that of the HO(10)&#x0002f;HO(9) double mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f4">4</xref>, compare lane 8 with lane 12).</p><p>To further assess the contribution of the weak-affinity sites HO(8) and HO(7), we mutated these sites in the context of the HO(10)&#x0002f;HO(9) double mutant. Mutation of either HO(8) or HO(7) shows further derepression of the promoter in this background (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>A, compare lane 5 with lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that the two weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites of URS1 can still partially repress <italic>HO</italic> transcription together, yet are unable to do so on their own. Note that in the HO(10)&#x0002f;HO(9) double mutant background, there is no contribution to repression by the HO(1) site, as mutation of this site did not derepress <italic>HO</italic> transcription any further (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>A, lane 6).</p><p>We also assayed for <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding to URS1 in these mutant strains by ChIP, using a polyclonal antibody to &#x003b1;2 and PCR primer set I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>A), which amplifies a region of the promoter from sites HO(9) to HO(7). As internal controls for these assays, we used primer sets that amplify the &#x003b1;2-Mcm1 site of the <italic>STE6</italic> promoter, which is bound by &#x003b1;2 in both haploid and diploid strains, and a portion of the <italic>YDL223c</italic> ORF, which is 10 kb away from <italic>HO</italic> and not bound or regulated by &#x003b1;2 in any known manner. As seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>B, &#x003b1;2 is present at URS1 in a wild-type diploid strain while being completely absent in a haploid <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> strain. Furthermore, there is roughly a wild-type level of &#x003b1;2 at URS1 when both HO(8) and HO(7) are mutated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>B, lane 3). Somewhat surprisingly, we did not observe amplification above background (i.e. the negative control band) for the <italic>HO</italic> primer set in any strain bearing the HO(10)&#x0002f;HO(9) mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>B, lanes 5&#x02013;8), while observing further derepression with additional mutations to sites HO(8) or HO(7) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>A, lanes 5&#x02013;8). This suggests that while HO(8) and HO(7) are still able to partially repress <italic>HO</italic> with URS2 deleted, the level of <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA binding by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 at these sites may be too low for detection by ChIP.</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP of Tup1 in a1-&#x003b1;2 site mutant strains</title><p>Despite the inability to detect &#x003b1;2 recruitment through sites HO(8) and HO(7), the observation that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 can partially repress the expression through these sites suggested that the Tup1-Cyc8 complex may still be recruited to URS1 in strains lacking the strong-affinity sites HO(10) and HO(9). Since Tup1-Cyc8 binds to the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c48">48</xref>), it is possible that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 can bind to the weak sites HO(8) and HO(7) at a level that is too low for detection by ChIP, but sufficient to recruit Tup1-Cyc8 to the promoter. We therefore utilized a plasmid-based, Myc<sub>13</sub>-tagged version of Tup1 to monitor Tup1 binding at URS1 by ChIP. Interestingly, while &#x003b1;2 was not detectable at URS1 when both sites HO(10) and HO(9) are mutated, Tup1 was detectable above the level of a blank control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>, compare lane 2 with lanes 3&#x02013;6). Tup1-Myc<sub>13</sub> was detected at URS1 when both HO(8) and HO(7) were left intact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>, lane 4), and when only HO(7) remained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>, lane 5). A faint band can still be seen at <italic>HO</italic> when only HO(8) is intact (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>, lane 6), suggesting that Tup1-Cyc8 can still be recruited by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 weakly binding at this site. Although it is possible that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 could recruit Tup1-Cyc8 through site HO(1), it should be noted that mutation of this site had no effect in combination with mutations in sites HO(10) and HO(9) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>, compare lane 5 with lane 6), whereas mutations to HO(8) and HO(7) in this context exhibited derepression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>, compare lane 5 with lanes 7 and 8).</p></sec><sec><title>ChIP of <italic>HO</italic> regulators following cell cycle arrest</title><p>Having established that <italic>HO</italic> is repressed by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding to sites of varying affinity, we next performed assays to address the mechanism by which <italic>HO</italic> is repressed by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 and the Tup1-Cyc8 co-repressor. To elucidate the mode of repression, we performed ChIP experiments to determine whether the Swi5 activator is able to bind to the <italic>HO</italic> promoter in the presence of <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 and its associated co-repressors. While Swi5 DNA-binding is not detectable at <italic>HO</italic> in asynchronous cultures, the brief binding of Swi5 to URS1 during the late anaphase stage of the cell cycle can be detected in synchronized haploid cells released from a block in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>). To monitor Swi5 binding by ChIP, we utilized a strain bearing a Myc<sub>9</sub>-tagged Swi5 that also contains a galactose-inducible <italic>CDC20</italic> to arrest the cells in G2 before mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>). We made this <italic>MAT</italic><bold><italic>a</italic></bold> strain pseudo-diploid by integrating a copy of <italic>MAT&#x003b1;</italic> at <italic>URA3</italic>. A culture of this strain was arrested and then aliquots for ChIP analysis were taken at timed intervals following release from the cell cycle block. Microscopic scoring of each time point indicated that the cells were synchronously released from the arrest and proceeded through the cell cycle (data not shown). The ChIP assays showed that the &#x003b1;2 protein bound to both the <italic>HO</italic> and <italic>STE6</italic> promoters through all stages of the assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>). In contrast, the Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> ChIP did not generate a significant band corresponding to the <italic>HO</italic> promoter for any of the collected time points, suggesting that Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> was not binding to the promoter. As a positive control for Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> immunoprecipitation, we also examined the <italic>EGT2</italic> promoter, which is activated by Swi5 and is not repressed in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c50">50</xref>). The ChIPs showed that Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> bound to the <italic>EGT2</italic> promoter in a manner that was temporally consistent with previous observations of Swi5 DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c9">9</xref>), indicating that a Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> ChIP was detectable in this strain and that the cells were properly synchronized. Immunoprecipitated DNA from time points that demonstrate Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> binding to the <italic>EGT2</italic> promoter were subjected to several different PCR conditions (see Materials and Methods) to examine binding at <italic>HO</italic>, but no signal above background was obtained (data not shown). We also repeated the assay with the haploid strain (K8144) that was used to make the pseudo-diploid strain (JRY200) and observed Swi5-Myc<sub>9</sub> binding at URS1 in a manner consistent with published results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f7">7</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c9">9</xref>). These assays suggest that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 and its associated co-repressors prevent, or greatly reduce Swi5 binding at URS1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transcriptional regulation through a complex promoter is an important process by which eukaryotic cells can coordinate several signals to express genes according to various intracellular and extracellular cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c51">51</xref>). The yeast <italic>HO</italic> promoter is an excellent model for this process, as it coordinates the signals of several sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins to regulate <italic>HO</italic> transcription according to cell-type and stage in the cell-cycle. <italic>HO</italic> is repressed in diploid yeast cells by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 heterodimer, which regulates several haploid-specific genes by binding to specific sequences within their promoters and subsequently recruiting the Tup1-Cyc8 co-repressor complex. Miller <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c2">2</xref>) identified 10 potential binding sites for the <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 complex within the <italic>HO</italic> promoter, and we have shown that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binds to these sites with widely varying affinities. Our data show that the initial events of <italic>HO</italic> activation at URS1 are repressed by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding mainly at the strong-affinity sites HO(10) and HO(9). While the weak-affinity sites HO(8) and HO(7) are dispensable for this process, these sites can partially repress <italic>HO</italic> (with URS2 deleted) in the absence of stronger affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites, indicating an auxiliary role for these sites. Both weak sites in URS1 are required for this partial repression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f5">5</xref>), suggesting a level of cooperation between the two sites. We found that either of these weak sites can still recruit the Tup1-Cyc8 corepressor complex to the <italic>HO</italic> promoter in the absence of detectable occupancy by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f6">6</xref>), suggesting that <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 need only transiently bind to these sites to recruit Tup1-Cyc8. This observation is not unprecedented, as Swi5 binds to URS1 too quickly to be observed in asynchronous cultures, yet sufficiently to recruit the SWI&#x0002f;SNF co-activator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c6">6</xref>). Our data suggest that while Tup1-Cyc8 is recruited by <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 bound to these weak sites, it may not be recruited at a level sufficient to prevent activation of <italic>HO</italic> by Swi5 and SWI&#x0002f;SNF. It is interesting to speculate a wider role for <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 in the regulation of genes whose promoters contain weak-affinity sites that deviate from an <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 consensus site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c32">32</xref>). Weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites that may not be readily identified by conventional computational searches may still serve to partially repress or attenuate the transcription of several genes. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that the promoters of the <italic>PDE1</italic> and <italic>MET31</italic> genes appear to have <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 repressor sites that are weakly bound by the complex and may partially repress transcription <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c52">52</xref>). If weak-affinity sites were functionally important, then one would expect that they would be conserved in related yeast species. Our finding that HO(7) and HO(8) are more highly conserved than many of the stronger repressor sites supports the model that they have a role in <italic>HO</italic> regulation. Weak <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 binding sites in other promoters, such as <italic>PDE1</italic> and <italic>MET31</italic>, and even weaker sites in the <italic>LSM1</italic> and <italic>REX2</italic>, are strongly conserved in related yeast species, suggesting these may have also role in fine tuning expression of these genes in diploid cells [R.A.O'F. and A.M.S., unpublished data; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c52">52</xref>)].</p><p>The placement of weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites around Swi5-Pho2 site B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh985f1">1</xref>A) may also underscore the importance of this element in activation of <italic>HO</italic> transcription. Mutation of Swi5-Pho2 site B has been shown to cause a more severe defect in <italic>HO</italic> expression than mutation of site A, indicating a greater contribution to the activation of <italic>HO</italic> transcription by site B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, Swi5 and Pho2 bind cooperatively to site B, while only binding in an additive manner to site A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c8">8</xref>). Although the <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 HO(7) and HO(8) sites are not absolutely required for <italic>HO</italic> repression in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, the conserved placement of these sites around Swi5-Pho2 site B may serve to maintain repression of the promoter in yeast strains, such as <italic>S.pastorianus</italic> and <italic>S.bayanus</italic>, lacking one or even both of the stronger sites in URS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c44">44</xref>). Our data have shown that mutation of either HO(10) or HO(9) weakly derepresses an <italic>HO</italic> promoter with URS2 deleted. However, the promoter is strongly derepressed when these mutations are made in combination with mutations of the HO(7) and HO(8) sites. The placement of the HO(7) and HO(8) sites on either side of the Swi5&#x0002f;Pho2 activator site may explain why HO(9) is not as highly conserved among the different yeasts as some of the other sites.</p><p>While the weak-affinity <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2 sites of URS1 serve an auxiliary role in repression of <italic>HO</italic> in yeast, their presence may give clues to potential functions for such sites in higher order eukaryotes. Many developmental processes feature the formation of gradients of transcriptional regulators that result in boundaries of gene expression and pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh985c54">54</xref>). The placement of weak-affinity repressor binding sites near a strong-affinity site may allow for sustained repression with limiting concentrations of the repressor, whereas genes regulated only by a strong-affinity site may be derepressed. This mechanism could be another level of attenuation of transcriptional regulation, and may further define gene expression boundaries near the end of a gradient of a repressor protein.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh985f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Position and sequence of <bold>a</bold>1-&#x003b1;2-binding sites of the <italic>HO</italic> promoter.
