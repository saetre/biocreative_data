The deduced protein sequence of Sox6 has considerable homology with that of the previously determined Sox5 sequence. It seems likely that these genes have diverged more recently than other members of the SOX gene family, although the two genes map to different chromosomes in the mouse. In common with Sox5, Sox6 is highly expressed in the adult mouse testis and the HMG domains of both proteins bind to the sequence 5'-AACAAT-3'. This suggests that the two genes may have overlapping functions in the regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis in the adult mouse. However, Sox6 may have an additional role in the mouse embryo, where it is specifically expressed in the developing nervous system.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0017-a" xlink:role="3369"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0018-a" xlink:role="3370"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0019-a" xlink:role="3371"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0013.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3365"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3366"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3367"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3368"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3369"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3370"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3371"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00017-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3372"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
