We show that the expression of a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, death receptor 3 (DR3; also known as TNFRSF25), is selectively elevated in Th17 cells, and that TL1A, its cognate ligand, can promote the proliferation of effector Th17 cells. To further investigate the role of the TL1A&#x02013;DR3 pathway in Th17 regulation, we generated a TL1A-deficient mouse and found that TL1A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> dendritic cells exhibited a reduced capacity in supporting Th17 differentiation and proliferation. Consistent with these data, TL1A<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals displayed decreased clinical severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Finally, we demonstrated that during EAE disease progression, TL1A was required for the optimal differentiation as well as effector function of Th17 cells. These observations thus establish an important role of the TL1A&#x02013;DR3 pathway in promoting Th17 cell function and Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: BMDC, bone marrow&#x02013;derived DC; CNS, central nervous system; DR3, death receptor 3; EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; i&#x02013;T reg cell, TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced T reg; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein; n&#x02013;T reg cell, naturally occurring T reg cell; PB, peripheral blood.</p></fn><fn><p>B.P.

A novel Th subset&#x02014;termed Th<sub>IL-17</sub>, Th17, or inflammatory Th&#x02014;has been recently identified as a distinct Th lineage that mediates tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Th17 differentiation is initiated by TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), and reinforced by IL-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>) and IL-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), in which STAT3 and two orphan nuclear receptors, ROR&#x003b1; and ROR&#x003b3;, mediate the lineage specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Despite rapid progress in understanding the molecular programs that govern Th17 differentiation, it is not clear how their proliferation, and ultimately function, are regulated in the context of immune responses and diseases.</p><p>Th cell activation and differentiation requires not only the recognition of the antigen&#x02013;MHC class II complex by the cognate TCR but also co-stimulatory signals. Previous experiments have indicated differential co-stimulatory regulation of Th1 and Th2 cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Over the past decade, our knowledge of how different ligand&#x02013;receptor pairing interactions contribute to T cell co-stimulation has been steadily expanded. Most of these pairs belong to either the B7-type molecules that bind CD28-like Ig superfamily receptors, or the TNF superfamily ligands that engage their receptor counterparts in the TNFR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Although we have previously shown essential roles of CD28 and inducible co-stimulator in Th17 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), the functional contribution of TNF and TNFR family members in regulating Th17 cell function is poorly understood.</p><p>Within the TNF family, CD40L, OX-40L, LIGHT, CD27L (CD70), and 4-1BBL have well-established functions in T cell activation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that another TNF family member, TL1A (Tnfsf15), also plays a role in T cell regulation. TL1A was first identified as a protein expressed on human endothelial cells and up-regulated in response to TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), although an earlier study only identified an irregularly spliced transcript. Subsequently, full-length TL1A was cloned, and expression of TL1A by human tissue macrophages, lamina propria T cells and plasma cells, and Fc&#x003b3;R-activated peripheral blood (PB) monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). TL1A binds death receptor 3 (DR3; also called TNFRSF25), a death domain&#x02013;containing TNFR family member that signals via NF-&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). DR3 expression is significantly increased upon T cell activation and was initially thought to be restricted to lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). However, recent data have expanded the number of cell types that express DR3 to also include NK cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Although DR3-deficient mice exhibit a partial impairment in the negative selection of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), the impact of DR3 deficiency on immune function has not been further explored. TL1A also binds to DcR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), a decoy receptor for TL1A, LIGHT, and FasL that is present in humans but not mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), suggesting additional complexity in the role of this pathway in humans.</p><p>Several lines of evidence point to a role for TL1A in modulating T cell activation. Under conditions of suboptimal anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, TL1A increases IL-2&#x02013;driven proliferation and IFN-&#x003b3; and GM-CSF production by human PB T cells, and in vivo administration of recombinant TL1A enhances mouse graft-versus-host reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Thus, despite the presence of a death domain in DR3, binding of TL1A to DR3 on T cells provides a co-stimulatory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). TL1A also synergizes with IL-12 and IL-18 in stimulating TCR-independent secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; by human PB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). The ability of TL1A to co-stimulate IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and the association of TL1A expression with areas of active inflammation in Crohn's disease have led to the hypothesis that TL1A acts as a Th1-polarizing cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). However, it was more recently shown that TL1A acted preferentially to enhance TCR-stimulated proliferation of memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), which was associated with an increased capacity of memory T cells to express IFN-&#x003b3;.</p><p>In the current study, we found that full-length DR3 expression is selectively elevated in Th17 cells and mediates their development and proliferation. Deficiency in TL1A in DCs substantially reduced their ability in supporting Th17 differentiation and proliferation. Consistently, TL1A KO animals exhibited decreased Th17 generation in vivo and reduced disease severity upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Additionally, the absence of TL1A in recipient mice also resulted in reduced severity of EAE disease induced by adoptive transfer of autoreactive Th17 cells. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that DR3&#x02013;TL1A interaction is important for the optimal function of Th17 cells and contributes to Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Th17 cells highly express DR3</title><p>Although considerable progress has been made in identifying the various cytokines and transcriptional factors critical for Th17 differentiation, molecular pathways selectively regulating the expansion and function of this important Th subset remain unclear. To address this, we analyzed gene expression profiles by microarray analysis of Th1, Th2, and Th17 effector cells and discovered that expression of DR3 (TNFRSF25), which binds to TNF family member TL1A, was significantly enhanced in Th17 cells when compared with the other two Th subsets (unpublished data). Because TNF family members regulate cell proliferation and survival, this result suggests the possibility that DR3&#x02013;TL1A interaction may be involved in the regulation of Th17 cells. To further confirm this observation, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from OT-II TCR transgenic mice were differentiated under Th1, Th2, or Th17 conditions, and mRNA was prepared on day 5 after restimulation and analyzed for DR3 expression by real-time PCR analysis. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, total DR3 expression was greatly increased in the Th17 subset compared with Th1 and Th2 cells, using a primer pair that allows detection of all DR3 isoforms. Furthermore, DR3 expression was not detected during the first 2 d of differentiation but was up-regulated by day 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), suggesting that DR3 up-regulation occurs at a later stage of Th17 differentiation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DR3 expression is greatly enhanced in Th17 cells.</bold> Naive OT-II cells were differentiated and DR3 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR analysis.

To identify the cytokine pathways involved in DR3 up-regulation, naive OT-II T cells were activated under different cytokine or Th17 conditions, mRNA was prepared from these cells on day 5 after activation, and total DR3 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR analysis. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, TGF-&#x003b2; alone induced DR3 expression, whereas IL-6 was not sufficient for DR3 induction. However, induction of DR3 is further enhanced in the presence of both TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Additionally, the blocking of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 (Th17 conditions) did not further enhance DR3 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 alone are sufficient to induce DR3 expression.</p><p>Among the three known DR3 isoforms in the mouse, variant 1 is the full-length DR3 that is capable of both ligand binding and intracellular signaling. Variant 2 is a soluble DR3 isoform that likely functions as a decoy receptor. Although variant 3 does contain both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, it lacks the fourth cysteine-rich domain in its extracellular region, and its capacity for ligand binding has yet to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to determine which isoforms are induced upon Th17 differentiation. Using isoform-specific primers, we found that the full-length, functioning variant 1 was highly up-regulated in Th17 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>).</p><p>Because TGF-&#x003b2; also induces Foxp3 expression in activated T cells, we examined whether T reg cells expressed DR3. Interestingly, both naturally occurring T reg (n&#x02013;T reg) and TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced T reg (i&#x02013;T reg) cells up-regulated DR3 expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). However, the full-length variant 1 represents a much higher proportion of the total DR3 isoforms expressed in Th17 cells as compared with n&#x02013;T reg or i&#x02013;T reg cells, supporting the preferential involvement of TL1A&#x02013;DR3 interaction in regulating Th17 cell function.</p></sec><sec><title>TL1A stimulation regulates Th17 development and proliferation</title><p>To establish the potential biological relevance of DR3 expression on Th17 cells, we first tested the effect of recombinant Fc-TL1A protein on Th17 differentiation, proliferation, and cytokine expression. Naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were activated with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of Fc-TL1A and in the presence of TGF&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-6 or Th17 differentiation conditions. In comparison to cells treated with a control Fc-containing protein, Fc-TL1A enhanced IL-2 secretion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). It has been recently shown that IL-2 signaling inhibits Th17 differentiation in a STAT5-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Consistently, percentages of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells were decreased by 40% in T cells differentiated in the presence of Fc-TL1A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). However, upon treatment with an anti&#x02013;IL-2 antibody, Fc-TL1A enhanced the differentiation of Th17 cells by 35% under TGF&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IL-6 conditions and 20% under Th17 conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

TL1A KO mice exhibited fewer mononuclear infiltrates and demyelination foci than WT control animals at day 27 after immunization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, B and C</xref>). These results indicate that the reduced clinical scores observed in the KO animals were likely caused by decreased inflammation and tissue damage in the CNS. Because our in vitro studies suggest that the TL1A&#x02013;DR3 pathway may be involved in the generation and/or function of pathogenic MOG-specific T cells during the course of EAE, the levels of T cell infiltration were further quantified by image analysis of anti-CD3 staining. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 D</xref>, TL1A KO animals had fewer CD3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells per spinal cord cross section than WT counterparts.</p><p>Several distinct factors could potentially influence the degree of CNS T cell infiltration in the context of EAE. To rule out the possibility that the lesser T cell infiltration seen in the spinal cords of TL1A KO animals was caused by a reduced ability of their T cells to survive in the CNS, Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling and anti-activated caspase-3 staining were performed to assess the extent of apoptosis in TL1A KO and WT CNS. The level of apoptosis in the WT spinal cord was low on days 21 or 27 after immunization. Furthermore, no increase in apoptotic cells was observed in the KO spinal cords (unpublished data), suggesting that T cell apoptosis is unlikely to be a contributing factor underlying the reduced infiltrating T cell numbers observed in the CNS of TL1A-deficient animals with EAE.</p><p>To determine whether the reduction in CNS T cell frequency seen on day 27 was caused by different temporal kinetics between WT and KO animals, levels of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the CNS (spinal cord and cerebellum) were assessed at multiple time points by flow cytometry. CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells start accumulating in the CNS of WT mice 1 or 2 d before the onset of clinical symptoms, and their levels peak at days 5&#x02013;7 after disease onset (unpublished data) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>).

Absolute numbers of CD45<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were also examined and showed a similar trend (unpublished data). These observations show that the effect of TL1A deficiency in reducing CD4 T cell levels in the CNS is evident early in and maintained throughout the disease course. In addition, there were dramatic reductions in the total numbers of recovered CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expressing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, and TNF-&#x003b1; in day 17 CNS cell isolates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Function of TL1A in the generation, expansion, and effector function of autoreactive T cells</title><p>By signaling through its receptor DR3, TL1A could potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases at multiple levels.

More impressively, a population of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells expressing both IL-17 and IFN-&#x003b3; was observed in WT mice, and was most consistently and dramatically reduced in the KO animals.

Our results showed that not only were more cells recovered with Fc-TL1A treatment, but more importantly, when transferred with the same number of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, mice receiving Fc-TL1A&#x02013;expanded cells developed EAE disease with 100% disease incidence and a peak clinical score of 2 (Fig. S5 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071364/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071364/DC1</ext-link>), whereas mice receiving control Ig&#x02013;expanded cells did not show any disease symptoms. Furthermore, when CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from MOG-immunized mice were expanded without IL-23, only a portion of the recipients of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cultured in the presence of MOG peptide and Fc-TL1A showed minimal signs of EAE disease development, with a mean clinical score of 1.33 in affected mice with 60% disease incidence, whereas recipients of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells cultured with MOG peptide and control Ig did not show any disease symptoms (Fig. S5 B). Therefore, these results indicate that in addition to participating in the efficient priming of autoreactive T cells, TL1A may further contribute to T cell&#x02013;mediated autoimmunity through promoting the proliferation of Th17 cells, as well as maximizing their pathogenic potential.</p><p>To definitively demonstrate that Th17 cells indeed require TL1A signaling to completely exert their disease-driving capacities in vivo, we again took advantage of the discussed adoptive transfer model of EAE, except in this case the pathogenic Th17 cells were differentiated and expanded in vitro under optimal IL-23 concentrations. The majority (&#x0223c;66&#x02013;86%) of the resulting MOG-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells appeared to be IL-17 producing, based on intracellular cytokine staining, and expressed DR3, including the full-length variant 1 isoform, as confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071364/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20071364/DC1</ext-link>).

Compared with the considerable progress on the various pathways important for the differentiation of Th17 cells from naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms governing the proliferation and function of effector Th17 cells. In this study, we have identified the TNF family ligand&#x02013;receptor pairing of TL1A&#x02013;DR3 as a novel regulator of Th17 cells.</p><p>TL1A, a member of the TNF superfamily, exerts its effects by binding and signaling through DR3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Previous studies have shown that recombinant TL1A enhances the IL-2 responsiveness of TCR-activated human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and promotes IFN-&#x003b3; secretion, and synergizes with IL-12 and IL-18 in stimulating TCR-independent secretion of IFN-&#x003b3; by human PB CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Additionally, mouse memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were reported to proliferate in response to TL1A stimulation, whereas naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were unresponsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). However, the effect of TL1A on Th17 cells was not investigated. Our results show that DR3 expression is enhanced in Th17 cells compared with Th1 and Th2 cells. Although differentiation of naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells into Th17 cells is promoted by the combinatorial action of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), our results reveal a novel role for TL1A in regulating Th17 differentiation. Although TL1A protein inhibited Th17 differentiation in vitro via increased IL-2 production, it promoted Th17 differentiation in the absence of IL-2 signaling. Consistently, lack of TL1A on DCs resulted in decreased Th17 differentiation by OT-II T cells. In these experiments, TL1A may act during the early stages of Th17 commitment and/or promote the expansion of Th17 lineage cells during differentiation. It has been proposed that Th17 survival and expansion are dependent on IL-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>), and that IL-23 maintains their pathogenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>); the precise function of IL-23 remains to be determined. Our observations suggest that TL1A expands Th17 cells and enhances the pathogenic potential of these cells when cultured with IL-23 at suboptimal levels. TL1A may thus synergize with IL-23 signaling in promoting the optimal effector functions of pathogenic T cells; the lack of this regulation may thus have contributed to reduced severity of EAE disease in the TL1A KO mice.</p><p>TL1A plays a specific role in expanding Th17 effector cells even in the absence of TCR stimulation, whereas IL-17 secretion was not increased upon TL1A stimulation, suggesting that TL1A primarily supports the proliferation of Th17 cells. It is possible that IL-17 secretion upon TL1A stimulation may require additional signaling pathways, e.g., from TCR or IL-23R. In contrast, TL1A did not affect expansion or IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by in vitro&#x02013;differentiated effector Th1 cells. Moreover, our data indicate that Th17 but not Th1 cell proliferation is supported by mature DCs independent of TCR stimulation. The significance of this finding is unclear at this stage, but this regulation may result in the expansion of Th17 cell numbers in the inflammatory tissues, which is important for early host defense against certain infection or inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as EAE. The homeostatic proliferation of Th17 cells in response to mature DCs appears to be dependent on TL1A&#x02013;DR3 interaction, as expansion of Th17 effector cells is selectively impaired in the presence of TL1A KO BMDCs. Our results suggesting the specific role of TL1A in Th17 effector cell expansion differ from previous reports that TL1A promotes expansion and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by Th1 cells. However, previous studies used mouse and human memory T cells that were generated in vivo. In addition, they did not examine the effect of TL1A on IL-17 or Th17 cells, nor did they demonstrate a role for endogenous TL1A in regulating IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). At this point, it is possible that TL1A regulation of effector and memory cells differs. Additionally, TL1A-mediated effects on Th1 cells may require the synergistic action of additional signaling pathways such as IL-12 or IL-18 cytokines, whereas TL1A alone is sufficient to induce Th17 proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Further experiments are needed to explore the differences in the action of TL1A on Th17 and Th1 effector and memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, which may shed additional light on the novel function of TL1A.</p><p>DR3 expression is also up-regulated in both n&#x02013;T reg and i&#x02013;T reg cells, consistent with the observation that TGF-&#x003b2; signaling primarily up-regulates DR3. In contrast to Th17 cells, T reg cells also up-regulate a DR3 isoform in which there is a deletion of cysteine-rich region IV in the extracellular domain (variant 3), as compared with full-length DR3 (variant 1). TL1A stimulation did not enhance the proliferation T reg cells. Our data also demonstrate that differentiation of T reg cells is not affected by TL1A recombinant protein or enhanced in the absence of TL1A signaling in vitro. In addition, we found that the percentages of FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the lymph nodes and spleens of MOG-immunized mice were similar in WT and TL1A KO mice (unpublished data). Further studies are required to understand the function of different isoforms of DR3 in T reg cells.</p><p>The physiological relevance of our findings was addressed using TL1A-deficient mice. TL1A KO mice exhibit a greatly decreased percentage of IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, as well as a significant decrease in the percentages of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and IL-17<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> double-producing cells after MOG immunization in vivo. Although TL1A does not regulate Th1 cell proliferation or differentiation in vitro, TL1A deficiency appears to affect IFN-&#x003b3; expression in vivo. Future studies are needed to investigate how TL1A is regulating these various cytokine producing subsets in vivo. It is possible that TL1A may regulate initial IL-2 expression and the extent of T cell proliferation. Alternatively, a defect in IL-17 expression may affect Th1 differentiation, as we recently observed reduced IFN-&#x003b3; production in IL-17&#x02013;deficient mice (unpublished data).</p><p>Although Th1 cells and IFN-&#x003b3; have long been implicated in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as EAE and collagen-induced arthritis, recent studies have shown that Th17 cells and IL-23 play pivotal roles in promoting inflammation and mediating disease pathogenesis. Our results indicate that TL1A-deficient mice show reduced disease severity and decreased accumulation of T cells in the CNS. Furthermore, TL1A plays an important role in the EAE disease pathogenesis induced by adoptively transferred Th17 cells from MOG-immunized mice. These data are consistent with the proinflammatory function of Th17 cells in EAE and support a role of TL1A in the regulation of Th17 cells in vivo. TL1A may function in draining lymph nodes where T cell priming occurs, and/or in CNS tissue where Th17 cells initiate tissue inflammation. Reduced Th17 cells in the spleen and lymph nodes in TL1A KO mice after MOG immunization support the former. Of note, DCs have been shown recently to present antigens and selectively regulate Th17 cells in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Reduced cytokine-expressing CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the CNS of TL1A KO mice after disease induction supports reduced Th17 expansion in the tissue, and thereby reduced IL-17&#x02013;induced chemokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show in this paper that TL1A expressed by mature DCs regulates Th17 differentiation, effector cell expansion, and function in EAE disease through its receptor DR3, which is selectively up-regulated in Th17 cells. This analysis reveals a novel and unique regulation of Th17 cells. Because TL1A and DR3 have been implicated in other inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>), targeting this pathway may be beneficial in patients with Th17-mediated diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>TL1A KO mice were generated on the 129/Sv background by a targeted deletion of exon 4 of the TL1A locus on chromosome 4C1.
