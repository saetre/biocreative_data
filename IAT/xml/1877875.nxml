Both technologies, however, can elicit undesirable off-target effects. We have used several model genes to study these effects in detail in the zebrafish, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Danio rerio</named-content>. Using the zebrafish embryo as a template, correct and mistargeting effects are readily discernible through direct comparison of MO-injected animals with well-studied mutants. We show here indistinguishable off-targeting effects for both maternal and zygotic mRNAs and for both translational and splice-site targeting MOs. The major off-targeting effect is mediated through p53 activation, as detected through the transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, acridine orange, and p21 transcriptional activation assays. Concurrent knockdown of p53 specifically ameliorates the cell death induced by MO off-targeting. Importantly, reversal of p53-dependent cell death by p53 knockdown does not affect specific loss of gene function, such as the cell death caused by loss of function of chordin. Interestingly, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, microarrays and whole-mount in situ hybridization assays show that MO off-targeting effects are accompanied by diagnostic transcription of an N-terminal truncated p53 isoform that uses a recently recognized internal p53 promoter. We show here that MO off-targeting results in induction of a p53-dependent cell death pathway. p53 activation has also recently been shown to be an unspecified off-target effect of siRNAs. Both commonly used knockdown technologies can thus induce secondary but sequence-specific p53 activation. p53 inhibition could potentially be applicable to other systems to suppress off-target effects caused by other knockdown technologies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recent advances in sequence-based approaches to &#x0201c;knockdown&#x0201d; gene function have opened the door to an array of approaches to uncover functions for genes of interest. Vertebrate knockdown strategies&#x02014;such as morpholinos (MOs) in zebrafish or RNA interference-based strategies in mammalian systems&#x02014;have been demonstrated to be effective, rapid, and cost-efficient reverse-genetic approaches for studying gene function. However, their deployment has to date been limited by a number of technical (genomic, biological, and off-targeting) hurdles. One of the notable and unexpected findings from our work using MOs has been a series of observations surrounding unanticipated effects that are independent of the intended gene target. We have identified and characterized a recently described p53 induction pathway due to off-targeting that appears to be shared between knockdown technologies. This study reconciles a series of unexpected findings that show p53 upregulation at the transcriptional level in a subset of short inhibitory RNA- and MO-treated vertebrate systems. Moreover, concurrent p53 knockdown provides a new approach to facilitate the identification of previously hidden gene functions. This study provides both a new gene knockdown enhancement tool as well as additional insight into an important and conserved pathway implicated in cellular toxicity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Robu ME, Larson JD, Nasevicius A, Beiraghi S, Brenner C, et al.

We further investigated the nature of this cell death and the mechanism of MO mistargeting. For this report, we focused primarily on MOs designed against two gene targets for which mutants have been previously described, <italic>wnt5</italic>/<italic>pipetail (ppt)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>smoothened</italic>/<italic>slow muscle omitted (smu)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, to facilitate the discrimination between specific and nonspecific effects. A translational MO against <italic>smoothened</italic> (Smo MO) induces characteristic <italic>smu</italic> phenotype (spinal curvature, U-shaped somites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). A splice-site <italic>wnt5 MO</italic> (Wnt5 MO1) induces tail and body-axis shortening and somite compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), characteristic of the <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>K). What both Smo MO- and Wnt5 MO-injected embryos (morphants) have in common is an additional and very similar neural death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>, arrows). This neural death is target-independent, since it is not exhibited by the respective mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>K) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Nonetheless, this neural death appears to be sequence-specific, since a completely different splice-site <italic>wnt5</italic> MO (Wnt5 MO2) shows no neural death, but readily induces the characteristic <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). We tested another type of knockdown molecule based on an alternating trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline/phosphate polyamide backbone called gripNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, a gripNA targeting <italic>wnt5</italic> (similar in sequence to Wnt5 MO1) also induces neural death along with the characteristic <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>I). A gripNA against <italic>smoothened</italic> also causes additional neural death (unpublished data), supporting the idea that the off-targeting effects are not limited to the MO chemistry, but represent a common feature to these knockdown technologies.</p><p>The off-target neural death induced by MOs is highly reminiscent of the neural death induced by a published Mdm2 MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>M). Mdm2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, the gene most frequently mutated in human cancers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Mdm2 knockout in mice is an embryonic lethal &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; due to extensive p53 upregulation and p53-induced apoptosis. Mdm2-targeted MO in zebrafish was reported to induce apoptotic neural death &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We examined the mechanism of MO-induced off-target neural death by testing for apoptosis in multiple MO-injected zebrafish embryos using a transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and by staining with acridine orange (unpublished data). Our results suggest that the neural death induced by off-targeting MOs is apoptotic in nature and was indistinguishable from the cell death observed in the Mmd2 knockdown &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. We tested the specificity of Mdm2 MO-induced cell death by overexpressing a Mdm2 RNA construct. However, we did not observe any significant rescue of the Mdm2 MO-induced cell death with the Mdm2 RNA construct (unpublished data). Therefore, it is possible that the cell death phenotype induced by the Mdm2 MO is also primarily an off-targeting effect. We performed an in-depth analysis of MO off-targeting to examine the concordance between the phenotypes observed by light microscopy and apoptosis patterns observed by TUNEL staining. We analyzed zebrafish embryos injected with Wnt5 MO1 at 14 hpf (the onset of cell death, &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;), 22 hpf, 26 hpf, and 30 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030078-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Brightfield images show the signature appearance of opaque-looking discolored tissue around the eyes and in the nervous system in embryos injected with Wnt5 MO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030078-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The extent of the opaque tissue increased at later time points and with increasing MO dose. The cell death could be more easily visualized using darkfield microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">Figures 3</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>O, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>R, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>U, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">3</xref>X, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>O, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>R, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>U, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>X). This analysis shows the characteristic pattern of white tissue corresponding to the opaque structures seen in brightfield that is diagnostic of MO mistargeting in zebrafish embryos.</p><p>At 26 hpf, milder phenotypes displaying a characteristic anterior-ventral concavity and/or hindbrain depression could be observed, in the absence of the opaque/white tissue characteristic of the more severe cases of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">Figure 4</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>F). However, when analyzed by TUNEL staining, we observed that even the mild phenotypes (as seen by light microscopy) were associated with significant apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">Figure 4</xref>P&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>R). These mildly affected embryos usually recovered by 30 hpf, when they showed significantly less cell death, if any (unpublished data). The more severely affected embryos did not recover until day 2 or 3, at which time the characteristic apoptotic tissue was no longer apparent either through light microscopy or TUNEL analysis (unpublished data). However, these embryos lacked some neural tissue and developed with smaller heads and eyes (unpublished data).</p><p>The punctuated pattern of neural apoptosis seen at all time points and with increasing intensity in the more severe cases was strikingly different from the normal apoptotic pattern seen in uninjected control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>). Developmentally regulated apoptosis has been described in detail &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; and was recapitulated by our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">4</xref>, uninjected embryos). However, at all studied time points the extent of developmentally regulated apoptosis was significantly less extensive than the apoptosis induced by MO off-targeting. In particular, at 30 hpf, little if any apoptosis was noted in control embryos. Therefore, we performed the TUNEL analysis at 30 hpf for all subsequent experiments to clearly differentiate between developmentally regulated apoptosis and apoptosis caused by MO off-targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>p53 MO Attenuates Off-Target Neural Death Induced by MOs</title><p>The neural apoptosis induced by a variety of MOs and the similarity to the phenotype induced by apparent p53 upregulation (Mdm2 MO) suggested the hypothesis that MO off-target effects can induce the p53 apoptosis pathway. Therefore, we tested whether p53 knockdown can rescue the off-target apoptosis phenotype induced by several MOs. Indeed, p53 MO attenuated the neural death induced by smoothened and Wnt5 MOs, as shown by morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">1</xref>F), acridine orange (unpublished data), and the more specific TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>F). Similar results were observed for p53 knockdown rescue of Mdm2 MO-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figures 1</xref>N and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>M). Interestingly, p53 MO also alleviated the neural death induced by the Wnt5 gripNA, suggesting that this additional knockdown technology can upregulate the p53 pathway due to off-targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figures 1</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>I). However, as expected, p53 MO did not have any effect on <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figures 1</xref>K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">1</xref>L, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>J, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>K). A second p53 MO of independent sequence also attenuated the off-target neural death, while a four-base mismatched MO did not show any effect (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>p53 MO as a Tool to Attenuate Neural Cell Death</title><p>Because neural death caused by MO-induced off-target effects is so frequent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, we tested the p53 MO as a tool to alleviate off-target neural death. A good tool for this purpose should be effective, innocuous, and specific. The p53 knockdown by itself does not induce any significant defects, as p53 is not required for normal development in mammals or fish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>B). Also, p53 MO does not affect the efficacy of gene-specific MOs, as it does not interfere with the penetrance of gene-specific phenotypes. To further confirm this, we tested whether p53 MO can affect the efficiency of splicing inhibition by Wnt5 MO1. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of Wnt5 RNA transcripts showed complete blockage of the splicing at exon 5&#x02013;exon 6 boundary targeted by Wnt5 MO1, which was not affected by p53 MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figure 1</xref>H).</p><p>We also investigated whether p53 knockdown can affect specific cell death (other than neural death) and whether it affects phenotypes not associated with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As shown by morphology and TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">5</xref>D), the p53 MO had no effect on the specific tail-cell death induced by the loss of function of <italic>chordin</italic> using a <italic>chordin</italic>-specific MO. In addition, p53 knockdown showed no effect on the MO-induced phenotypes of <italic>nacre</italic> (a pigment defect) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">Figure 5</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">5</xref>H), <italic>no tail</italic> (a developmental patterning gene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">Figure 5</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">5</xref>J), or UROD (loss of function is visualized by fluorescence of red blood cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">Figure 5</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g005">5</xref>L).</p><p>In conclusion, the p53 MO could be an efficient tool to attenuate off-target effects of MOs.

This strategy has greatly attenuated the neural death phenotypes and has notably eased the interpretation of the observed phenotypes, especially in craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>; see below). p53 knockdown or the use of p53 null zebrafish &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d; could potentially be of value for use in more traditional genetic approaches, such as chemical or insertional mutagenesis screens, to decrease the collateral tissue damage due to p53-induced cell death that potentially masks important phenotypes of particular interest to investigators.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>p53 MO as a Tool to Facilitate the Study of Craniofacial Development</title><p>Early neural death and loss of neural tissue caused by MO off-targeting could potentially affect later craniofacial development. This may generate numerous false positives in MO screening for genes important in craniofacial development. For example, we tested whether p53 co-knockdown could facilitate the analysis of craniofacial phenotypes, especially in the cases of unknown genes or where corresponding mutants are not available.

The brightfield panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A show two types of milder neural defects that we have described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g004">Figure 4</xref>; an anterior-ventral concavity for SP2054 and SP2063 (represented by a deficiency in the frontonasal tissue development, black arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A) and a depressed hindbrain for SP2035 (represented by a lack/developmental delay of the hindbrain tissue, black arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). Interestingly, these milder defects were clearly associated with neural apoptosis, as shown by acridine orange staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, fluorescence panels and quantified in corresponding graphs). At higher doses, the MOs against these targets showed a clear cell death pattern even in brightfield images (represented by opaque structures; unpublished data).</p><p>Later in development (4 dpf), the MO-injected embryos mentioned above also exhibited craniofacial defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). We investigated whether these late craniofacial defects were due to the early loss of neural tissue (off-targeting) or to a specific role of the targeted genes in craniofacial development. To achieve this, we analyzed the effect of p53 MO on the cartilage structure at 4 dpf. The craniofacial defects in the SP2035 and SP2054 MO-injected embryos were not affected by p53 co-knockdown, while the craniofacial defects in the SP2063 MO-injected embryo were significantly diminished by p53 co-knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). These results suggest that SP2035 and SP2054 are involved in craniofacial development, while the craniofacial defects seen in SP2063 MO-injected embryo are p53-dependent and thus may be due solely to off-targeting effects of the MO.</p><p>To further distinguish putative roles of SP2035, SP2054, and SP2063 in craniofacial development, we analyzed the expression patterns of these genes in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030078-sg002">S2</xref>). At 1 dpf, all three genes were expressed in the craniofacial region. But while the expression patterns of SP2035 and SP2054 were spatially restricted, SP2063 was more ubiquitously expressed. Interestingly, in subsequent days of development, SP2035 and SP2054 transcripts became specifically enriched in the pharyngeal arches primordia, while SP2063 became restricted to central nervous system structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g007">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030078-sg002">S2</xref>). These expression patterns support a direct role of SP2035 and SP2054 in craniofacial development, while the role of SP2063 may be indirect, if any. The CNS expression of SP2063 may also explain the partial rescue of the SP2063 craniofacial phenotypes by p53 MO. If brain structures were affected by SP2063 MO injection, this may have influenced the mechanical structure of cartilage and contributed to the craniofacial phenotype, in conjunction with the loss of neural tissue caused by MO off-targeting.</p><p>In conclusion, the likely involvement of the studied novel genes in craniofacial development is supported by their expression pattern and corroborated with the dependence of craniofacial phenotypes on p53. Therefore, p53 co-knockdown can be used to help clarify craniofacial phenotypes induced by MOs against novel genes for which there are no mutant data available for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>p53 Pathway Is Induced in Morphants with Neural Death</title><p>To understand better the mistargeting effects of MOs, we investigated other components of the p53 pathway.

We tested whether p21 transcription is induced in morphants with neural death.

Very importantly, this increase in p21 expression was dependent on p53, since knockdown of p53 significantly decreased p21 RNA levels in respective morphants. Induction of p21 levels provides direct evidence for activation of the p53 protein. These results were similar to the induction of p21 in Mdm2 MO-injected embryos, which was dependent on p53, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g008">Figure 8</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

Curiously, ongoing synthesis of full-length p53 is required for cell death, while transcription of the &#x00394;113 p53 isoform is a consistent and striking component of the mistargeting MO signature. We investigated various hypotheses for the mechanism underlying this off-target effect. The p53 pathway induction is independent of the intended gene target and appears to be sequence-specific, since two MOs of independent sequence, but targeted to the same gene, have strikingly different effects on p53 induction. This off-target effect is noted in both translational blockers and splice-site MOs, suggesting that the mechanism does not uniquely involve the transcription or the translation machinery. According to our analysis, MOs with off-target effects do not exhibit any overt primary sequence similarity to repeated elements such as rRNA genes or the zebrafish mitochondrial genome (unpublished data).</p><p>Although the mechanism of MO-induced p53 activation is still unclear, this pathway is activated by other knockdown technologies including gripNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">Figures 1</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g001">1</xref>J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g002">2</xref>I, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030078-g009">9</xref>C).

In many cases, neural death can be a specific phenotype, and p53 MO rescue may suggest a specific interaction with the gene of interest. A key experiment to validate a MO phenotype is to observe rescue of the morphant phenotype with an RNA or DNA construct of the respective gene. If the neural death is rescued by the RNA/DNA construct, it is very likely that the gene of interest is specifically involved in cell death. If, however, the RNA/DNA rescue still yields a neural death phenotype, it is possible that the neural death is an off-target effect of the MO. For example, a recent study reported apoptosis and neuronal loss upon knockdown of presenilin enhancer Pen-2 in zebrafish embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. This neural death was significantly reduced by p53 co-knockdown, as in the case of off-targeting MOs.

However, we did not observe any significant rescue (unpublished data). One potential explanation is that this particular Mdm2 MO also has off-targeting effects. Five additional Mdm2 MOs have been reported to cause cell death that could be rescued by p53 MO &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030078-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, but we did not test any of these. We also tested whether the Wnt5 MO1-induced cell death is <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> specific or a result of off-targeting.

However, we did not observe any rescue of the characteristic morphological defect associated with loss of <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> either. This result is not so surprising, though, as there is no previous report on a successful RNA rescue of the body axis shortening phenotype caused by <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> inactivation (either mutation- or MO-induced). It is possible that generalized overexpression of <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> RNA may not be sufficient to compensate for decreased <italic>wnt5/ppt</italic> levels at the appropriate time and place.</p><p>In conclusion, if a cell-death phenotype caused by knockdown can be rescued by the respective RNA/DNA construct, it is likely that the gene of interest is involved in cell survival. If the RNA/DNA construct rescues the gene-specific phenotype but does not rescue the cell death phenotype observed in MO-injected embryos, it is likely that cell death represents an off-targeting effect of the MO. It is also possible that certain MO-induced phenotypes cannot be rescued by corresponding RNA/DNA overexpression, due to improper localization and/or timing of expression during development.</p><p>Ongoing work is geared to exploit p53 co-knockdown to alleviate off-target neural death of MOs and to discover the mechanism by which off-target MOs induce p53 activation as well as the signature &#x00394;113 p53 transcript.

Lateral views (A, D, G, J, M, P, S, V, and Y), all others dorsal head views. Intermediate cell death is observed at 14 hpf as highly localized opaque cells in the head (large arrow in D), which are arranged near the lateral (arrowhead in E and F) and midline (small arrow in E and F) areas of the developing brain. This pattern progresses through 22 and 30 hpf (M&#x02013;O and V&#x02013;X), including a concentration of opaque cells surrounding the emerging folds of the brain midline (small arrows N&#x02013;O and W&#x02013;X) and the eye (arrowheads N&#x02013;O and W&#x02013;X).
