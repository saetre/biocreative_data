Sensitized nociceptors have a lowered threshold of activation and increased spontaneous activity, which result in symptoms of hyperalgesia and pain, respectively. The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ligand-gated ion channel has been implicated in the hyperalgesia for mechanical and osmotic stimuli associated with inflammatory states. To investigate whether TRPV4 directly contributes to the mechanisms of inflammatory mediator sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors, we compared the effect of the injection of simplified inflammatory soup (prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>and serotonin) into the mechanical receptive fields of C-fibers in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Following the injection of the soup, the percentage of C-fibers responding to a hypotonic stimulus and the magnitude of the response was significantly greater in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>mice compared to TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Moreover, in response to simplified inflammatory soup only C-fibers from TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>mice exhibited increased spontaneous activity and decreased mechanical threshold. These marked impairments in the response of C-fibers in TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice demonstrate the importance of TRPV4 in nociceptor sensitization; we suggest that TRPV4, as TRPV1, underlies the nociceptive effects of multiple inflammatory mediators on primary afferent.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a member of the vanilloid subfamily of transient receptor potential ligand-gated ion channels, cloned from hypothalamus using a functional assay screening for osmo-sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] or kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], is also present in sensory neurons that express properties of nociceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].

To establish the contribution of TRPV4 in inflammatory mediator-induced sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors, <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the effect of inflammatory mediators that engage TRPV4 function in behavioral studies, on the response of C-fibers to osmotic and mechanical stimulation in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice. The percentage of C-fibers responding to hypotonicity as well as the magnitude of the response, is significantly greater in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>but not TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This finding demonstrates a contribution of TRPV4 to inflammatory mediator-induced sensitization of C-fibers to hypotonic stimuli. This finding also has clinical relevance since water is an irritant, exacerbating painful conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and changes in tissue osmolarity have been reported in diseases that are associated with painful peripheral neuropathy such as diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and alcoholism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, recent reports suggest that TRPV4 may also act as a mechano-transducer in primary afferent nociceptors; mice lacking a functional TRPV4 gene have impaired behavioral responses to intense noxious mechanical stimuli but normal response to low-threshold mechanical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to TRPV4 reverses mechanical hyperalgesia in a rat model of small-fiber painful peripheral neuropathy induced by the cancer chemotherapy agent Taxol<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, while the baseline mechanical paw-withdrawal threshold is not significantly different between TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice, after intraplantar injection of simplified inflammatory soup, mechanical hyperalgesia only occurred in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Similarly, mechanical hyperalgesia induced by simplified inflammatory soup, in the rat, is prevented by spinal intrathecal treatment with TRPV4 antisense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These findings suggested a role for TRPV4 in inflammatory mediator-induced sensitization of nociceptors to mechanical stimuli. Our present study actually demonstrated, <italic>in vivo</italic>, the role of TRPV4 in nociceptor sensitization, the mechanism underlying primary mechanical hyperalgesia. In agreement with behavioral studies demonstrating similar mechanical nociceptive thresholds in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the mechanical thresholds of C-fibers from TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice were not significantly different. However, intradermal injection of simplified inflammatory soup lowered mechanical threshold in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>but not TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>C-fibers, supporting the idea of an <italic>in vivo </italic>contribution of TRPV4 to inflammatory mediator-induced sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors to mechanical stimuli.</p><p>Inflammatory mediators, such as PGE<sub>2 </sub>and 5-HT act directly on primary afferent nociceptors, to decrease their threshold of activation, increase spontaneous activity and increase response to supra-threshold stimuli (for review) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; whereas spontaneous activity of peripheral nociceptors may contribute to ongoing pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In this regard, it is noteworthy that simplified inflammatory soup enhanced spontaneous activity in C-fibers from TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>but not TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice. This result is also compatible with the recent suggestion that depending on the cellular context some TRP channels may mediate increases in neuronal excitability through activation of intracellular signaling pathways rather than through the binding of a specific ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that the simplified inflammatory soup constituting two inflammatory mediators (PGE<sub>2 </sub>and 5-HT) can act synergistically through cAMP to engage TRPV4 in mechanical hyperalgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The role of TRPV4 not only in mechanical and osmotic hyperalgesia but also in the inflammatory mediator-induced increase in spontaneous activity in primary afferent nociceptors suggests that TRPV4 contributes to peripheral sensitization via the nociceptive effects of multiple inflammatory mediators. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first report suggesting a role for TRPV4 in any form of spontaneous pain.</p><p>Not previously reported, TRPV4 may also play a role in the regulation of spontaneous activity of nociceptors, even in the absence of inflammation; spontaneous activity of C-fibers is about 20-fold <italic>higher </italic>in TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice than in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>mice. Thus, low level of on-going activity in primary afferents may not always result in spontaneous pain. The significant change of primary afferent activities can be more important as we observed in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>mice after simplified inflammatory soup. Of note, C-fiber conduction velocity is similar in TRPV4<sup>+/+ </sup>and TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Since nerve conduction velocity is a measure of the excitability of voltage-sensitive channels in neurons, a variation in its value would reflect compensatory changes in voltage-gated ion channels in the axon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the difference in spontaneous activity is less likely to result from compensatory changes in most of the voltage-gated channels found in axons, but may reflect a contribution of TRPV4 in the modulation of membrane potential and the generation of action potentials in primary afferent nociceptors. The contribution of TRPV4 to spontaneous activity in primary afferent nociceptors, both in physiological and inflammatory states, support findings in other cell types where TRPV4 alters cell function by modulating complex calcium events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle compensatory abnormalities in ion channel function in the TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mouse are responsible for the change of the spontaneous activity. Anyway, the actual mechanism of spontaneous activity of primary afferents in TRPV4<sup>-/- </sup>mice remains to be further elucidated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using <italic>in vivo </italic>single fiber electrophysiology, we demonstrate a role of TRPV4 in inflammatory mediator-induced sensitization of C-fibers to hypotonic and mechanical stimuli. Moreover, TRPV4 may play a broader role in inflammatory pain, also contributing to the spontaneous pain induced by the action of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, we suggest that TRPV4 may play a similar role as TRPV1 which underlines mechanical and thermal sensitivities in the sensitization of primary nociceptive afferent, acting as a final pathway for the nociceptive effects of multiple inflammatory mediators and second messenger signaling to mediate primary afferent nociceptor sensitization to mechanical stimuli and, therefore, mechanical hyperalgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal model</title><p>Experiments were performed on 24&#x02013;34 g adult male C57BL6 mice lacking a functional TRPV4 gene (TRPV4<sup>-/-</sup>) and TRPV4 wild-type (TRPV4<sup>+/+</sup>) littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (initially 50 mg/kg, i.p., with additional doses given throughout the experiment to maintain areflexia). Recordings were made from C-fibers in the saphenous nerve, which innervates part of the dorsal surface of the hind paw. Bipolar stimulating electrodes were placed under the nerve, distal to the recording site. The nerve was cut proximal to the recording site and put on a platform for further dissection. Fine fascicles of axons were teased from the nerve and placed on a recording electrode. There usually are more than one fiber in the fasicle from which our recordings are made (often two or three). Single units were first detected by electrical stimulation of the nerve. Each fiber's conduction velocity was calculated by dividing the distance between the stimulating and recording electrodes by the latency of the electrically-evoked action potential. Fibers that conducted slower than 2 m/s were classified as C-fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. C-fiber receptive fields were located using a mechanical search stimulus, either a blunt probe with smooth tip or a 60 g von Frey hair (VFH). The electrically evoked action potential corresponding to the C-fiber whose mechanical receptive field had been identified was verified by the latency delay technique, in which electrically evoked spikes resulted in longer latency when the receptive field of the same fiber was stimulated mechanically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].
