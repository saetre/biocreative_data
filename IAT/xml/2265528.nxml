The enzymology of DNA methyltransferases is well understood, but the mechanism that removes methylated cytosines from DNA (active DNA demethylation) has remained enigmatic. Recently, a role of the growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein GADD45A in DNA demethylation has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000013-Barreto1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. We have investigated the function of GADD45A in DNA demethylation in more detail using gene reactivation and DNA methylation assays. Contrary to the previous report, we were unable to substantiate a functional role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation. The mechanism of active DNA demethylation in mammalian cells remains unknown.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During mammalian development, genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs both in developing germ cells and in fertilized oocytes. This rapid DNA demethylation is an active process that occurs in the absence of DNA replication. The mechanism of active DNA demethylation represents a conundrum for researchers in this field, i.e. the breakage of a carbon-carbon bond to remove a methyl group from the DNA cytosine ring appears energetically unfavorable, and the elimination of approximately 30 million 5-methylcytosine bases from both DNA strands within a short time window raises questions about the maintenance of genome stability during this process. Recently, it has been reported that the protein GADD45A, a small acidic protein that has been implicated in the DNA damage response, plays a crucial role in promoting active DNA demethylation in several mammalian cell lines. We noticed that GADD45A does not fulfill one likely requirement for a mammalian DNA demethylase factor in that it is not expressed in oocytes or zygotes. We then investigated the role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation using methylated reporter plasmids and DNA methylation analysis of several endogenous genes in cell lines overexpressing GADD45A. Contrary to the previous report, we were not able to demonstrate a role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation. The activity that promotes DNA demethylation at a genome-wide level in mammals remains to be identified.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian DNA methylation patterns are thought to be generally quite stable throughout cell divisions due to faithful maintenance of DNA methylation patterns during DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000013-Pfeifer1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

This replication-independent DNA demethylation would imply the existence of a mammalian DNA demethylase enzyme that can either actively remove the methyl group from 5-methylcytosine or can remove the entire methylated base or nucleotide, perhaps in a base excision repair-like pathway. Direct breakage of a carbon-carbon bond seems energetically unfavorable. If not strand-specifically coordinated, the excision repair pathway would put the genome at risk for DNA double strand breakage. The mechanistic steps and proteins involved in DNA demethylation in mammals are currently unknown.

In addition, it is not immediately apparent why genomic DNA demethylation should occur under conditions where GADD45A is induced, i.e. growth arrest or DNA damage.

The sequences analyzed for demethylation in the Oct4 promoter-EGFP construct were the same as those analyzed by Barreto et al. The methylases used and the restriction enzyme sites tested were the same. In addition to HpaII cleavage, as done by Barreto et al, we used sodium bisulfite sequencing which is considered the method of choice for high resolution DNA methylation analysis. We were also unable to confirm GADD45A-induced DNA demethylation of methylated endogenous genes (LINE1 promoter, <italic>RASSF1A</italic> and <italic>TIG1</italic>-associated CpG islands in HEK293 cells and the Oct4 promoter in NIH3T3 cells).</p><p>Barreto et al have also used GADD45A-specific siRNAs to support a role of GADD45A in DNA demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000013-Barreto1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.
