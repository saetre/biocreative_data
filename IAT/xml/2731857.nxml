Previous studies have shown that palladin is localized to the axonal growth cone in neurons and may play an important role in axonal extension. Previously, we have generated palladin knockout mice which display cranial neural tube closure defect and embryonic lethality before embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5). To further study the role of palladin in the developing nervous system, we examined the innervation of palladin-deficient mouse embryos since the 200 kd, 140 kd, 90&#x02013;92 kd and 50 kd palladin isoforms were undetectable in the mutant mouse embryo brain. Contrary to the results of previous studies, we found no inhibition of the axonal extension in palladin-deficient mouse embryos. The cortical neurons derived from palladin-deficient mice also showed no significant difference in neurite outgrowth as compared with those from wild-type mice. Moreover, no difference was found in neurite outgrowth of neural stem cell derived-neurons between palladin-deficient mice and wild-type mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that palladin is dispensable for normal neurite outgrowth in mice.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurite outgrowth in immature neurons is an essential differentiation step during embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Neurite outgrowth, which is driven by actin-based motility of the growth cone, is critical for the establishment of the neuronal network.

Our results suggest that palladin is not essential for normal neurite outgrowth and elongation.</p><p>Many lines of evidence indicate that palladin plays a critical role in organizing the actin arrays required for normal cell adhesion and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Goicoechea1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Using the palladin knockout mouse embryos and fibroblasts cultured from palladin knockout embryos, we confirmed this conclusion. The NTD and body wall defect of palladin-deficient embryos prove that palladin is required for normal cell motility and adhesion during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Luo1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, palladin-deficient fibroblasts have shown defects in cell motility, adhesion, integrin expression, and actin organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Liu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, the neurite extension, which was expected to be stunted, was found to be normal both in palladin-deficient mouse embryos and in neurons derived from palladin-deficient embryos. Whole-mount immunostaing of NF clearly demonstrates that axon growth and morphology of DRG neurons innervating the limbs are normal in palladin-deficient embryos. In the forebrain and midbrain of mouse embryos, however, palladin deficiency causes failure of neural tube closure and eversion of neuroepithelium followed by perturbed innervations. Nevertheless, neurites do show extensive growth. This phenomenon indicates that palladin deficiency impairs cell movement and cell adhesion of neuroepithelium during neurulation, but does not impair neurite outgrowth and extension of neurons in the neuroepithelium. In addition, quantitative <italic>in vitro</italic> studies performed on primary cortical neurons confirm this conclusion.</p><p>To further understand the role of palladin during the development of the nervous system, we investigated the neuronal differentiation of palladin-deficient NSCs. Palladin-deficient NSCs are able to proliferate as neurospheres and to differentiate into neurons (Tuj1-positive), oligodendrocytes (O4-positive) and astrocytes (GFAP-positive) as wild-type NSCs. Moreover, the palladin deficiency does not change the percentage of neurons, oliogodendrocytes and astrocytes significantly after differentiation (data not shown). In addition, we performed neurite outgrowth assays on NSC derived-neurons, and demonstrated through quantitative analysis that loss of palladin does not inhibit neurite outgrowth. To fully understand the function of palladin, we also generated palladin-deficient ES cell lines. While examining the pluripotency of ES cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, we observed the morphology of neurons derived from ES cells. Preliminary observation indicates that the palladin-deficient ESC-derived neurons are able to extend neurites as long as wild-type ESC-derived neurons (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006916.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>During the development of the cerebral cortex, neurogenesis is ongoing in the compact ventricular zone (VZ) in the early phase, after which the post-mitotic neurons migrate to the marginal zone (MZ) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Temple1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Hatten1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Accordingly, we have taken note of the cortical neuron distribution in the E13.5 cerebral cortex. In the wild-type cerebral cortex, neurons are located in the MZ. Though the palladin-deficient cerebral cortex fails to form cephalic ventricle structure and gives rise to the exposure of VZ to the outside, the cortical neurons are still able to migrate to the MZ (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006916-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is likely that palladin deficiency does not impair the cortical neuron migration at an early developmental stage of the cerebral cortex. However, this assumption requires further study.</p><p>In our mouse model, all the 200 kd, 140 kd, 90&#x02013;92 kd and 50 kd palladin isoforms are missing. These isoforms share the common C-terminus and the proteins have been confirmed based on our data and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Wang1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Liu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data implicate that these palladin isoforms detected are dispensable for neurite outgrowth in mice. However, even more palladin isoforms are predicted according to the NIH AceView database reports, including the N-terminal isoforms do not share the common C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Rachlin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, whether the N-terminal isoforms exist in the mouse nervous system and play a role in the neurite outgrowth still requires further investigations.</p><p>Palladin belongs to a family of actin-associated scaffolds including the Z-disc proteins myopalladin and myotilin. Myopalladin's expression is highly restricted to cardiac and skeletal muscle, while myotilin's expression is highest in skeletal muscle and moderate in heart and peripheral nerves. Though myotilin is highly expressed in the peripheral nervous system in mouse embryos during development, no report suggests that myotilin plays a role during neurite growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006916-Otey1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason, further study is needed to determine whether myotilin can functionally compensate for loss of palladin during neurite growth.</p><p>We also try to understand the apparent discrepancy between the previous study and ours. In the previous study, down-regulation of palladin in cultured neurons and neuroblastoma cells was achieved by using the vector expressing the palladin antisence fragment which is derived from the C-terminus of palladin (AF205078). The acute down-regulation of the expression of palladin isoforms sharing the C-terminus of palladin led to inhibited neurite outgrowth in the cultured cells. Comparing to previous study, our study is based on the genetic modified mice, in which part of the palladin C-terminus was deleted. It is possible that the function of palladin in mouse nervous system could be compensated by other unknown proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> during the development of mouse embryogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we report that palladin is not essential for normal neurite outgrowth. However, palladin function in growth cone behavior requires further exploration. It is reasonable to generate palladin conditional knockout mice in order to study palladin function in mice after embryogenesis. Under these conditions, more classic experiments, for example, assays on axon guidance and axonal connectivity, can be performed to help build a fuller understanding of the function of palladin in the nervous system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice containing a heterozygous deletion for palladin were maintained on 129SvJ background.
