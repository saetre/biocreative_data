They are transported on Golgi-derived membranous organelles, called Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs), from the neuronal soma to distal axonal locations, where they participate in assembling new synapses. Despite their net anterograde transport, PTVs move in both directions within the axon. How PTVs are linked to retrograde motors and the functional significance of their bidirectional transport are unclear. In this study, we report the direct interaction of Bassoon with dynein light chains (DLCs) DLC1 and DLC2, which potentially link PTVs to dynein and myosin V motor complexes. We demonstrate that Bassoon functions as a cargo adapter for retrograde transport and that disruption of the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interactions leads to impaired trafficking of Bassoon in neurons and affects the distribution of Bassoon and Piccolo among synapses. These findings reveal a novel function for Bassoon in trafficking and synaptic delivery of active zone material.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In neurons, the transport of membranous organelles along axons is based on molecular motors that propel organelles along microtubules, which, in axons, are oriented uniformly, with their plus ends pointing toward the growing tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burton and Paige, 1981</xref>). Anterograde transport is driven by members of the kinesin family of molecular motors, whereas retrograde transport relies mainly on the cytoplasmic dynein 1 motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vale, 2003</xref>). The role of anterograde transport in trafficking of axonal proteins is well documented, and molecular motors carrying axonal cargoes were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirokawa and Takemura, 2005</xref>). Two classes of vesicular cargoes were studied in the context of presynaptic assembly in neurons; synaptic vesicle (SV) precursors transported by kinesin-3 heavy chain KIF1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okada et al., 1995</xref>) probably linked via the cargo adapter liprin-&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2005</xref>), and Piccolo-Bassoon transport vesicles (PTVs) linked via the syntaxin1&#x02013;syntabulin adapter complex to KIF5B, which is the heavy chain of conventional kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2007</xref>). Imaging of most anterogradely transported axonal cargoes reveals that they move bidirectionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schroer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that most cargoes are able to associate with both anterograde and retrograde motors. However, little attention has been paid to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms and physiological meaning of retrograde transport of material predestined for delivery to distal axonal locations.</p><p>Bassoon and Piccolo (also named Aczonin) are highly homologous core components of CAZ (cytomatrix at the active zone; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">tom Dieck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenster et al., 2000</xref>).

It was shown that the accumulation of Bassoon and Piccolo at nascent synaptic junctions temporally correlates with activity-induced SV recycling and often precedes clustering of postsynaptic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Friedman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>).

Bassoon associates with the dynein motor complex in neurons, and disruption of Bassoon&#x02013;DLC binding results in deficits in axonal trafficking of PTVs in living neurons. Our findings reveal a novel function of Bassoon (i.e., directly connecting PTVs to molecular motors), thus assuring their active transport toward nascent synapses. Moreover, they provide new insights on the importance of bidirectional transport for appropriate cargo trafficking during synapse formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Bassoon can interact with DLC1 and DLC2</title><p>To identify novel proteins interacting with Bassoon, the cDNA fragment Bsn2 covering aa 609&#x02013;1,692 of rat Bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Seven independent positive clones carried the cDNA of DLC1. In subsequent experiments, the DLC-binding interface of Bassoon was narrowed down to fragment Bsn12 (aa 1,360&#x02013;1,441) and Bsn9 (aa 1,441&#x02013;1,692). Baits covering the other parts of Bassoon did not show any binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The binding region (fragment Bsn7), which is situated between two Piccolo-Bassoon homology domains, does not contain any predictable structural features. Moreover, an alignment of the amino acid sequence between PBH4 and PBH5 with the corresponding Piccolo region showed only 10% identity and 17.4% similarity. In line with this, overlapping constructs Pclo1 and Pclo2 covering the corresponding region of rat Piccolo (aa 1,878&#x02013;2,729) did not interact with DLC1 in yeast, implying that the DLC1 interaction interface of Bassoon is not conserved in Piccolo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). DLC2 also interacted with fragments Bsn12 and Bsn9 but not with Pclo1 and Pclo2 in yeast.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of the DLC-binding region on Bassoon.</bold> (A) Overview of Bassoon fragments tested for binding to DLC1 in yeast two-hybrid assays.

To this end, Flag-tagged DLC1 or DLC2 were expressed together with EGFP-Bsn7 in HEK293T cells, and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on cell lysates 48 h later using anti-GFP antibodies. Western blot (WB) analysis confirmed the successful coprecipitation of EGFP-Bsn7 with overexpressed DLC1 and DLC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>) and with endogenous DLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref>), demonstrating the existence of Bassoon&#x02013;DLC complexes in living cells.

In control experiments, we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate DLC1 or DLC2 when coexpressed with EGFP. Collectively, binding assays in yeast and mammalian cells demonstrate that Bassoon can interact with both DLC1 and DLC2 via an interaction interface not conserved in Piccolo.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of three functional DLC-binding motifs on Bassoon</title><p>Two independent Bassoon regions located on fragments Bsn9 and Bsn12 bind DLCs. To identify the exact DLC-binding site, we screened the amino acid sequence of both regions for sequences similar to published DLC-binding consensus motifs (K/R)XTQT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo et al., 2001</xref>) and GIQVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2001</xref>). Two TQT motifs are present in the sequence of the Bsn9 fragment. Short constructs with the sequences ATAEFSTQTP and PMVAQGTQT, covering the first and second TQT motifs, respectively, can indeed bind DLC in yeast. The respective mutant constructs with TQT motifs replaced by AAA did not bind DLC in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). To verify that there are no additional DLC-interacting sequence motifs in Bsn9, we generated mutants in which the first (Bsn9<sup>II</sup>), the second (Bsn9<sup>III</sup>), or both (Bsn9<sup>II,III</sup>) TQT motifs were replaced by AAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that the mutation of both binding motifs was necessary and sufficient to disrupt the interaction between Bsn9 and DLC1 or DLC2. Assessment of colony number and size suggested that DLC binding of Bsn9<sup>III</sup> is impaired to a greater degree than that of Bsn9<sup>II</sup>, which showed binding basically undistinguishable from Bsn9. Fragment Bsn12 contains an SQT motif instead of the canonical TQT motif. Construct Bsn12<sup>I</sup>, in which SQT was replaced by AAA, was unable to bind DLC1 or DLC2, indicating that the putative DLC-binding motif present in this fragment was inactivated by the mutation. Of note, the replacement of the central Gln residue by Ala in all identified motifs only partially disrupted DLC binding (unpublished data).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of three independently functional DLC-binding sites in Bassoon.</bold> (A) Bassoon constructs including the amino acid substitutions introduced at interaction sites I, II, and III and their relative lengths; bordering amino acid numbers refer to rat Bassoon.

As expected, fragment Bsn9 was recruited to mitochondria when coexpressed with Mito-EGFP-DLC1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807155/DC1">Fig. S2, C and D</ext-link>) or Mito-EGFP-DLC2 (not depicted). The mutation of both TQT motifs disrupted the recruitment of Bsn9<sup>II,III</sup> but not of construct Bsn7<sup>II,III</sup>, which still contained the SQT motif functioning as the DLC interaction interface. Additional mutation of this motif (in Bsn7<sup>I,II,III</sup>) completely disrupted DLC binding of this fragment. Construct Bsn12, which exhibited binding in yeast, was not recruited to mitochondria in COS-7 cells expressing Mito-EGFP-DLC1 or Mito-EGFP-DLC2, presumably as the result of steric hindrance. The results of the yeast two-hybrid and corecruitment assays in COS-7 cells are tabulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>. To further confirm the importance of identified binding motifs, EGFP-Bsn7, -Bsn9, and -Bsn13 and their mutants EGFP-Bsn7<sup>I,II,III</sup>, -Bsn7<sup>II,III</sup>, -Bsn9<sup>II,III</sup>, and -Bsn13<sup>I,II,III</sup> were expressed in HEK293T cells and precipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Coprecipitation of overexpressed and endogenous DLC was detected using an anti-DLC antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 G</xref> and Fig. S2, A and B), confirming that mutation of all identified motifs is required to disrupt the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interaction.</p><p>Inspection of the primary structure of Bassoon orthologues in different vertebrate species showed an absolute conservation of the second and third DLC-binding motifs despite the divergence of the adjacent sequences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807155/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). The first motif was conserved only in birds and mammals but not in zebrafish. The high degree of conservation throughout vertebrate species suggests that the DLC&#x02013;Bassoon interaction might be of functional significance.</p><p>DLC1 and DLC2 are very similar proteins with 93% sequence identity. However, it has been proposed that they are sequestered to distinct protein complexes, as shown for dynein or myosin V motor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naisbitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthalakath et al., 2001</xref>). To assess a possible preference of the binding sites on Bassoon for the two DLC isoforms, we expressed and purified a set of His-thioredoxin fusion proteins covering the first, second, and third or all three binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>) and tested their relative binding affinities to purified GST-DLC1 or GST-DLC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>) using surface plasmon resonance technology. The results did not reveal any binding preference for single motifs, but we observed significantly higher binding of fragments Bsn9 (motifs II and III) and Bsn13 (all three motifs) to GST-DLC2 compared with GST-DLC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref> and Fig. S3 B). The assay also confirms that the interaction of Bassoon and DLC is direct. Notably, we observed an increase of the relative binding affinities starting with fragments Bsn9<sup>II</sup> and Bsn9<sup>III</sup> (containing one DLC-binding site) to Bsn9 (containing two) and finally Bsn13 (containing three binding sites; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Thereby, site I seems to bind more tightly than sites II and III, and the relative binding affinities seem to be additive as DLC binding of Bsn13 represented roughly the sum of that of Bsn9 and Bsn12. In agreement with this set of data, we find decreased amounts of DLC coprecipitating with EGFP-Bsn7<sup>II,III</sup> compared with EGFP-Bsn7 (Fig. S2 B). These observations imply that the arrangement of three DLC-binding motifs in close proximity facilitates binding of Bassoon to DLC in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Bassoon-transporting vesicles associate with dynein and myosin V</title><p>In young neurons, Bassoon is transported into the axon associated with membranous organelles, the PTVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dresbach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tao-Cheng, 2007</xref>). One important cellular function of DLC is linking molecular motors to their cargo. Therefore, we wondered whether Bassoon already associates with DLC during its transport from the cell body toward nascent synapses and whether this interaction might be relevant for Bassoon&#x02019;s delivery to the presynapse.

In this study, we asked whether Bassoon transport organelles also recruit dynein- and/or myosin V&#x02013;based motor complexes, both of which contain DLCs. To this end, we enriched PTVs by subcellular fractionation of embryonic brain homogenates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhai et al., 2001</xref>). Most Bassoon immunoreactivity was found between 0.8 and 1 M sucrose containing synaptic plasma membranes, but significant amounts were also present at the interface between 0.3 and 0.8 M sucrose containing floating PTVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). In both membrane fractions, immunoreactivity was not observed if the samples were preincubated with Triton X-100, confirming that floating of Bassoon depends on its membrane association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Intriguingly, DLC as well as IC74 (the intermediate chain of 74 kD) and dynein heavy chain (DHC), which are both exclusive components of dynein motor complexes, and myosin V were also detected in the 0.3&#x02013;0.8 M sucrose interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Floating of all of these proteins was disrupted upon detergent treatment. This supports the view that Bassoon-carrying PTVs contain both dynein and myosin V motor complexes. To demonstrate conclusively the association of PTVs with multiple motors, we immunoisolated PTVs from the light membrane fraction using the Bassoon-specific monoclonal antibody mab7f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">tom Dieck et al., 1998</xref>).

The degree of colocalization of Bassoon, DLC, IC74, and myosin V was quantified by determining the overlap coefficients (OCs) for each stain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807155/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>) and comparing them with the overlap of Bassoon and cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, which labels mitochondria. The mean OC of costaining for Bassoon and Piccolo (OC = 0.701 &#x000b1; 0.017; <italic>n</italic> = 10), which is known to be cotransported on the same vesicle, was not significantly different from the OC of costaining for Bassoon with DLC (OC = 0.661 &#x000b1; 0.019; <italic>n</italic> = 21), IC74 (OC = 0.643 &#x000b1; 0.015; <italic>n</italic> = 19), or myosin V (OC = 0.755 &#x000b1; 0.029; <italic>n</italic> = 10).

At the analyzed stage (5 DIV), neurons have formed only a few synapses, and the majority of Bassoon is associated with PTVs. Therefore, the colocalization of Bassoon-positive puncta with DLC, IC74, and myosin V in young neurons further supports the notion that these proteins are present on PTVs.</p></sec><sec><title>Bassoon can function as a cargo adapter in COS-7 cells and associates with dynein motor complex in neurons</title><p>When DLC1 or DLC2 were targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane in COS-7 cells, the localization of mitochondria was remarkably distinct from that of mitochondria in cells expressing the control construct Mito3-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A1, B1, and D1</xref>). Normally, mitochondria are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of cells, sometimes even in their most distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2 A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6 A1</xref>, arrows). In contrast, targeting of DLCs to mitochondria results in their accumulation near the cell center, presumably as the result of DLC-mediated retrograde transport along microtubules via dynein. To test whether Bassoon can function as a cargo adapter, we targeted the fragment Bsn9 to the outer mitochondrial membrane and observed the subcellular localization of mitochondria. After expression of Mito3-EGFP-Bsn9, mitochondria were clustered near the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) of COS-7 cells, as visualized by costaining of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, B1 and B2</xref>). Targeting of the mutant fragment Bsn9<sup>II,III</sup>, which cannot bind DLC, to mitochondria did not alter their subcellular localization, confirming that an interaction with DLC was required for retrograde transport in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C1</xref>). Treatment of COS-7 cells expressing Mito3-EGFP-Bsn9 with the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole for 2 h before fixation and staining led to a disruption of clusters, whereas treatment with the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D had no effect on cluster formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, D1 and E1</xref>).

This is in line with the previously reported high diversity of binding sites identified among known DLC-interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lajoix et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, none of three DLC-binding sites of Bassoon is conserved in its paralogue Piccolo. Mutated Bassoon fragments, in which the essential (T/S)QT motifs were replaced by AAA, did not interact with DLCs neither in biochemical assays nor in yeast or mammalian cells. Therefore, it is likely that Bassoon binds DLCs via the target-interacting groove of DLCs, which is the interaction interface also shared by other known DLC interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lo et al., 2001</xref>). Quantitative in vitro binding assays revealed that all three sites are active, that site I has a higher relative affinity for DLCs than sites II and III, and that binding strengths seem to be additive. Moreover, fragment Bsn7<sup>II,III</sup>, bearing only one DLC-binding motif, coprecipitated DLC from HEK293T cells less efficiently than fragment Bsn7, which bears all three. Thus, the cluster of three DLC-binding motifs constitutes a multivalent interaction interface in Bassoon that is likely to facilitate the DLC&#x02013;Bassoon interaction.</p><p>In agreement with the high homology of DLC1 and DLC2, Bassoon was observed to bind both isoforms. However, quantitative binding assays with Bassoon fragments containing two or three DLC-binding interfaces showed significantly higher affinity for DLC2 than for DLC1. Because of the lack of DLC1- and DLC2-specific antibodies, we were unable to examine binding partner preferences of Bassoon in vivo.</p><p>One important cellular function of DLCs is to link their binding partners to dynein- or myosin V&#x02013;dependent transport processes. In neurons, DLCs were shown to bind postsynaptic scaffold molecules like guanylate kinase-associated phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naisbitt et al., 2000</xref>) or gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>), and active retrograde transport was proposed as a mechanism contributing to activity-dependent remodeling of the postsynaptic receptor apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maas et al., 2006</xref>). However, the functional role of DLCs as cargo adapters for dynein motors has become a subject of recent debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vallee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbar, 2008</xref>). The binding of DLC cargoes occurs in the same binding groove as the binding to dynein motor complex via IC74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). In this configuration, the DLC interaction partners would probably compete with the dynein motor complex for binding to DLC rather than being linked to the dynein motor complex via DLC. In this study, targeting of DLC-binding Bassoon fragments to mitochondria led to their accumulation near the cell center (probably the MTOC). This accumulation was dependent on both intact DLC-binding motifs and assembled microtubules and is best explained by assuming retrograde transport of Bassoon-tagged mitochondria. Similarly, a point mutation of the DLC-binding motif in the protein Egalitarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Navarro et al., 2004</xref>) or deletion mutants of Swallow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnorrer et al., 2000</xref>) or Dazl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) deficient in DLC binding showed defects in their dynein-mediated transport. In this study, we observed that Bassoon associates with the dynein motor complex in vivo and that the mutation of its DLC-binding motif has profound effects on microtubule-dependent transport when expressed in primary neurons. These findings support the view that Bassoon, via its interaction with DLCs, might function as a cargo adapter for the retrograde motor dynein.</p></sec><sec><title>Bassoon links dynein and myosin motors to PTVs</title><p>Recent studies established that newly synthesized Bassoon is transported toward nascent synapses associated with Golgi-derived vesicular structures, PTVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dresbach et al., 2006</xref>).

As the molecular link to retrograde transport remained unknown, we followed the hypothesis that interaction of Bassoon with DLC might be relevant in this context. Our data suggest that DLCs associate with mobile Bassoon packets, which also contain DHCs possibly linked through DLCs. Accordingly, the retrograde transport of PTVs along microtubules could be driven by the dynein motor complex recruited via Bassoon, although Bassoon is most likely not the only cargo adapter for dynein on PTVs. For example, voltage-dependent Ca channels, which were identified as potential components of PTVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>) and can interact with the DLC tctex-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 2005</xref>), might represent such an alternative cargo adapter.</p><p>Why are organelles such as PTVs, which are designated for axonal targeting, equipped with both anterograde and retrograde motors when unidirectional anterograde transport might be simpler and more economical? Regulated bidirectional movement of organelles might assure their relative uniform distribution in the outgrowing axon to be available for efficient synapse formation all along the axon.</p></sec><sec><title>What might be the physiological role of the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interaction in neurons?</title><p>To assess whether the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interaction links PTVs to microtubule-based axonal transport, the mobility of vesicles carrying either GFP-tagged wild-type Bassoon or DLC binding&#x02013;deficient Bassoon were compared. Bidirectional movement observed in both cases implies that the perturbed DLC binding does not interfere with the appropriate sorting of Bassoon to transport packages, which are expected to also carry endogenous Bassoon. Nonetheless, a significant decrease in the overall mobility of GFP-BsnDBM&#x02013;bearing vesicles as compared with GFP-Bsn&#x02013;carrying vesicles was observed. A plausible explanation might be that bidirectional motors are tightly cross-regulated, i.e., when a motor for one direction is disturbed, the opposite motor does not simply take over. This is well demonstrated by mutants of kinesin heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldstein, 2001</xref>), kinesin light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gindhart et al., 1998</xref>), or DHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 1999</xref>), which result in the accumulation of their respective cargoes in axons but not strictly in their accumulation in the cell body or in distal part of axons. Moreover, it was hypothesized that the presence of multiple classes of motor proteins on one vesicle might cooperate to avoid collision when two vesicles are transported in opposite direction on the same microtubule track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Welte, 2004</xref>). Thus, the increased number of immobile particles may reflect the predisposition of Bassoon particles with perturbed links to dynein motor complexes to be involved in &#x0201c;traffic jams&#x0201d; on microtubule tracks.</p><p>The analysis of vesicle movements in retrograde and anterograde directions revealed significant decreases in retrograde and anterograde velocities as well as in running distances in both directions for DLC binding&#x02013;deficient Bassoon compared with the wild-type GFP-Bassoon. Effects on the anterograde transport by interference with components of retrograde molecular motors like DHC or dynactin have also been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gross et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2005</xref>). This has been attributed to the necessity of efficient coordination of opposite-polarity motors by one another.</p><p>Despite the numerous immobile vesicles seen at 5 DIV in neurons expressing GFP-BsnDBM, normal localization of the construct with respect to pre- and postsynaptic markers was observed at 14 DIV, when synaptogenesis declines and PTVs are reduced in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhai et al., 2000</xref>). However, interference with the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interaction leads to significant increase in mean Bassoon and Piccolo levels at individual synapses of transected neurons compared with controls. DLC-mediated transport of Bassoon and Piccolo away from synapses might be part of a protein exchange process fine-tuning synaptic amounts of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuriel et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2009</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis revealed a striking increase in variability of both Bassoon and Piccolo contents at individual synapses. This confirms that the transport of both proteins is tightly linked and suggests that interference with Bassoon&#x02019;s interaction with DLC causes a defect in the trafficking of their common carrier.</p><p>It was proposed that synaptogenesis occurs in two phases. Initially, SV precursors traveling along microtubule tracks pause or stop at locations predefined by yet unknown mechanisms. This leads to the formation of &#x0201c;orphan&#x0201d; transmitter release sites that can accumulate active zone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sabo et al., 2006</xref>). In the second step, the initially formed site can split, and release-capable packages containing SVs and active zone material start to travel bidirectionally along axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krueger et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the primary capturing of presynaptic scaffold molecules can occur at nascent synaptic sites in a random fashion. Their subsequent bidirectional active distribution among adjacent synaptic boutons might represent a mechanism assuring formation of a rather homogeneous synapse population. In line with this hypothesis, PTVs, after interference with Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interactions, are stranded at the places where their transport paused because they cannot be transported further as a result of their impaired capacity to bind dynein. The high variance in synaptic levels of Bassoon and Piccolo could reflect the inability to more evenly redistribute the stochastically deposited clusters of PTVs during initial phases of synaptogenesis.</p><p>The levels of SV proteins synaptophysin and vGLUT1 were decreased in synapses of neurons overexpressing the DLC-capturing fragment Bsn9. The actual reason for this observation is currently unclear. As Piccolo was recently identified to negatively regulate SV exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leal-Ortiz et al., 2008</xref>), the decrease of SV markers might be caused by increased levels of Piccolo. In the dominant-negative approach achieved by overexpression of Bsn9, synaptic levels of the CAZ protein Munc13 were not changed. This argues that interference with the Bassoon&#x02013;DLC interaction did not have a general pleiotropic effect on axonal transport and is in line with described mechanisms of Munc13 synaptic targeting. Munc13 is recruited to synapses via the Rab3-interacting molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2006</xref>), which, in turn, is localized to synapses depending on the presence of CAZ-associated structural protein/ERC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>). Synaptic targeting of CAZ-associated structural protein is partly independent from Bassoon, which is consistent with the finding that it is not transported exclusively on PTVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohtsuka et al., 2002</xref>). Preliminary experiments confirm that specific blockade of Bassoon&#x02019;s exit from the trans-Golgi network does not disrupt the transport or appearance of Munc13 at synapses (unpublished data).</p><p>The amount of the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 also remained unchanged. As the size of pre- and postsynaptic elements is tightly coregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schikorski and Stevens, 1999</xref>), additional Bassoon and Piccolo molecules detected in a subpopulation of synapses after expression of dominant-negative Bsn9 might not be inserted into presynaptic plasma membrane but accumulate within the presynaptic bouton. Perhaps PTVs are affected, after they dissociate from microtubules in synaptic areas, in their switch to myosin V driving their transport toward the presynaptic plasma membrane along actin filaments. Our immunostaining and immunoprecipitation experiments of PTVs confirm an association of myosin V with PTVs. Whether this switch from microtubule- to actin-based motors also involves DLC&#x02013;Bassoon interactions will be the subject of future investigations.</p><p>Altogether, our experiments have shown that Bassoon interacts with DLCs in neurons, that this interaction is essential for proper movement of Bassoon transport packets along the axon, and that disruption of the interaction affects the accurate distribution of the CAZ scaffolding proteins Piccolo and Bassoon to the sites of neurotransmitter release.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of constructs</title><p>The pMito3-EGFP vector was generated by introducing aa 1&#x02013;33 of rat TOM20, coding for its mitochondrial targeting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanaji et al., 2000</xref>), into a eukaryotic expression vector, which was derived from pCMV-Tag3A (Agilent Technologies) by excision of the myc tag.

The GFP-Bsn construct used in this study was described previously as GFP-Bsn95-3938 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dresbach et al., 2003</xref>), and the mRFP-Bsn construct, in which GFP was replaced by mRFP, is its analogue. Cloning of Bsn1&#x02013;4 fragments was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dresbach et al., 2003</xref>). All other Bassoon and Piccolo constructs were generated using PCR with extended primer, thereby adding BamHI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the fragments, respectively. The introduced restriction sites were used for in-frame cloning of fragments into the vectors pGADT7, pGBKT7, pEGFP-C2 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), pMito3-EGFP, and pmRFP-C2, which was constructed by introducing the mRFP sequence (gift from R.Y. Tsien, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) instead of the EGFP sequence into the pEGFP-C2 plasmid. The coding sequence of DLC1, flanked at its 5&#x02032; end with EcoRI and at its 3&#x02032; end with XhoI sites, was generated by PCR using extended primers. Accordingly, the coding sequence of DLC2 was flanked with BamHI (5&#x02032; end) and XhoI (3&#x02032; end). The introduced restriction sites were used for in-frame cloning of fragments into the plasmids pGADT7, pGBKT7, pCMV-Tag2C (Agilent Technologies), pMito3-EGFP, pEGFP-N1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), and pGEX-5X (GE Healthcare).

Bassoon fragments were cloned into the multiple cloning site of the resulting plasmid using appropriate restriction sites. Short fragments coding for the second and third DLC-binding interfaces of Bassoon were constructed by in-frame insertion of synthetic oligo-deoxynucleotides coding for the respective sequence into pGADT7 or pGBKT7 vectors. All mutations described were introduced by inverse PCR using primers with mutated sequence and corresponding Bassoon fragments subcloned in pBluescriptII SK<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (Agilent Technologies) as a template. cDNA of EGFP-synapsinIa was a gift from T.A.
