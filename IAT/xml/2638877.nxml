However, the mechanisms which modulate the response of monocytes to inflammatory stimuli are still poorly understood. Here, we report that tribbles-2 (trb-2) is a novel regulator of inflammatory activation of monocytes. Down-regulation of trb-2 levels potentiates LPS-induced IL-8 production via enhanced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and jun kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In keeping with this, the endogenous level of trb-2 expression in human primary monocytes is inversely correlated to the cell&#x02019;s ability to produce IL-8. We show that trb-2 is a binding partner and a negative regulator of selected MAPKs. The potential <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of these findings is highlighted by the observation that modified low-density lipoprotein profoundly down-regulates trb-2 expression, which may, in turn, significantly contribute to the inflammatory processes in the development of vascular disease. Taken together, our results define trb-2 as a potent novel regulator of monocyte biology, controlling the activation of these cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>IL-8</kwd><kwd>MAP kinases</kwd><kwd>tribbles</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of tribbles proteins has recently been identified as potent regulators of signal processing in a number of physiological and pathological processes. Of the three vertebrate tribbles, tribbles-2 (trb-2) was first described as a gene up-regulated by mitogens in dog thyroid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Most of the recent data on this gene and its protein product are observational, describing differential expression in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>), autoimmune uveitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) and inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Functional studies on trb-2 have demonstrated its involvement in the progression of mitosis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and that it is necessary for the normal development of the eye and the neuronal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). A role for trb-2 in cell division is suggested as gene expression is up-regulated in a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias (AML), and retroviral over-expression of trb-2 induces AML in mice possibly via enhancing degradation of certain C/EBP protein forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). These results are in line with previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which demonstrated that levels of the fly homologue of C/EBP (<italic>slbo</italic>) are critical for programmed mitosis and that <italic>slbo</italic> turnover is regulated by tribbles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>While the potential importance of tribbles is implicated by these reports and other literature, less is known about the molecular mechanism of their action. Members of tribbles family have been reported to interact and modulate the activity of signal transduction pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>) systems. The functional relevance of tribbles-mediated regulation of these pathways has been highlighted by a recent report suggesting that trb-2 controls adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). We have shown recently that trb-1 regulates the proliferative capacity of vascular smooth muscle cells via action on MAPK pathways and found this gene to be up-regulated in the wall of atherosclerotic arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). These observations prompted us to further investigate the potential involvement of tribbles proteins in cell types, which play a central role in innate immune responses as well as in the chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall.</p><p>Monocytes play a central role in the initiation of innate inflammatory responses. Once activated by pathogenic stimuli or cytokines, they normally reside at the sites of inflammation, differentiate to macrophages and coordinate local responses via the expression of a range of cytokines and chemokines, which attract and activate other cell types. It is therefore of crucial importance to the physiological resolution of inflammation to have effective control mechanisms in place which control monocyte/macrophage responses. Activation and recruitment of monocytes to the developing lesion of the arterial wall are essential in the progression of atherosclerosis. Once in the lesion, monocytes produce chemokines, such as IL-8 and cytokines, including IL-1, that further perpetuate the local inflammation. Monocytes differentiate into macrophages that can internalize oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) particles, leading to their differentiation into foam cells. In addition, binding of modified LDL will itself regulate monocyte function.</p><p>Among others, activation of MAPK has been widely reported as a key intracellular signalling network, contributing to inflammatory activation of monocytes, as measured by the production of IL-8 chemokine, for instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). However, mechanisms for the down-regulation of these pathways are still ill defined. With the recent identification of tribbles proteins as regulators of MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>), we set out to investigate the role of tribbles in the inflammatory activation of monocytes. We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>) have reported that tribbles expression is regulated by a range of stimuli, including stress, mitogens and cytokines, suggesting that control of signalling systems may be achieved through the modulation of expression of tribbles proteins.</p><p>We report here that expression of trb-2 is selectively down-regulated by acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL). The consequence of reduced trb-2 expression is the potentiation of IL-8 production both in THP-1 cells and in human primary monocytes. Our results demonstrate that trb-2 acts via inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and jun kinase (JNK) activation. The molecular action of trb-2 is at the level of trb-2&#x02013;mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKK) complexes, MKK7 and MEK1, that are binding partners of this protein in monocyte/macrophages. Further, we show that the kinase-like domain of trb-2 is sufficient for binding to MAPKKs, as well as to exert its bioactivity. Co-stimulation of THP-1 cells as well as human primary monocytes with LPS and modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leads to the enhancement of IL-8 production, probably via down-regulation of trb-2. This raises the possibility that regulation of trb-2 levels could be a novel control mechanism of both physiological and pathological inflammatory activation of monocytes. Putting these observations together, we suggest that <italic>in vivo</italic> modulation of trb-2 expression may be an important regulatory mechanism in monocyte biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All the experiments described in this study were performed multiple times (<italic>N</italic> &#x0003e; 2) and representative datasets are shown.</p><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The human samples were obtained under the ethical approval granted by the North Sheffield Research Ethics Committee.

This approach is based on the observation that the interaction of two fusion proteins, expressing the proteins of interest, coupled to the N- or C-terminal portion of EYFP will lead to re-folding of the YFP fragments and will generate a functional fluorophore. Therefore, by using this approach, the interaction of proteins can be visualized in live cells. The PCA plasmids trb-2-V2 and MEK1, MKK4/7 -V1 were generated by tagging trb-2 and MKKs with half of Venus mutant YFP (V1 and V2) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). The Venus variant of YFP was used in this assay since it provides a higher signal than EYFP. MKKs and Trb-2 were fused to the N-terminal (V1) or to the C-terminal portions of Venus YFP (V2), respectively. The two expression constructs (trb-2 and one of the MKKs) were co-transfected and the YFP signal was visualized by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figs 4C and 5A&#x02013;D</xref>) and fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). As controls, proteins expressing a leucine&#x02013;zipper in fusion with the N- or C-terminal region of Venus protein (zip-V1 and Zip-V2, respectively) were used. When these two proteins are co-expressed, a strong fluorophore is formed. Therefore, we used this construct pair as a positive control. To detect the level of &#x02018;background&#x02019; in this assay arising from unspecific interactions, the combination of zip-V1 and trb2-V2 constructs (which are not expected to interact) was co-expressed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>AcLDL reduces trb-2 expression in monocytes</title><p>In order to identify molecular regulators of monocyte responses by modified LDL in the context of inflammation, we first characterized the regulation of trb-2 expression by AcLDL and LPS in a monocytic cell line, THP-1 cells. Given the recent reports highlighting an important regulatory function for trb-2 in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), we focussed our studies on this member of the tribbles family. oxLDL and AcLDL share many basic mechanisms of their action, including receptors (although oxLDL may sometimes use additional receptors as well) and signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). THP-1 cells were incubated with AcLDL or LPS and expression of trb-2 was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). While AcLDL incubation resulted in a profound down-regulation of trb-2 expression, LPS-induced activation resulted in a significant but transient down-regulation of trb-2 expression. Next, we tested whether AcLDL stimulation of THP-1 cells has an impact on inflammatory activation of monocytes, specifically on LPS-induced IL-8 production. Our results show that AcLDL treatment significantly potentiates maximally induced IL-8 production by LPS in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). AcLDL treatment alone did not induce IL-8 production, ruling out LPS contamination as a source of potentiation in the combined treatment. To validate our findings, the ability of human primary monocytes to produce IL-8 in response to LPS stimulation was similarly assessed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(D)</xref>, co-incubation with AcLDL increased the amount of IL-8 produced in response to LPS, similar to that seen in the monocytic cell line, THP-1.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>AcLDL and LPS modulates trb-2 expression and inflammatory activation of monocytes.

As the above data indicated a negative role for trb-2 in IL-8 production, we hypothesized that trb-2 may exert its effect through reducing MAPK activation.

As an additional control, the MEK1&#x02013;trb-2 complex was also detected in a co-immunoprecipitation system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4(D)</xref>. Further to the above, trb-2/MEK1 and trb-2&#x02013;MKK7 complexes were visualized by fluorescent microscopy, in the macrophage cell line Raw264.7 cells, by PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In agreement with the FACS results, no interaction between trb-2 and MKK4 was detected in this assay (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that trb-2 specifically interacts with MEK1 and MKK7 but not with MKK4 in monocyte/macrophage cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The kinase-like domain of trb-2 is necessary for MAPKK binding and for the inhibition of activating protein-1 activation</title><p>Tribbles proteins are comprised of an N-terminal, proline-rich N-terminal domain, a central domain, which is similar to serine&#x02013;threonine kinases but thought to be catalytically inactive, and a short C-terminal domain of unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). We have demonstrated previously that the central kinase-like domain of tribbles-1 is required for its ability to inhibit AP-1 activation, which is a well-characterized target of stress kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). In addition, we showed recently that this domain is sufficient for the formation of trb-1&#x02013;MKK4 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). However, there are no data available to date to evaluate whether the kinase-like domain is a generic requirement for tribbles action within the protein family. Here, we performed a similar analysis of trb-2&#x02013;MAPKK complexes, using HeLa cells, where we have characterized and validated the biological mechanism of action of tribbles proteins previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). First, we expressed full-length or truncated trb-2 proteins, the latter lacking either the N- or the C-terminal tribbles domains. The ability of these proteins to inhibit activating protein-1 (AP-1) activation was assessed in a luciferase reporter system, where stress kinase pathways, leading to the phosphorylation and thus the activation of AP-1 transcription factor was induced by over-expressed MEKK1 (Stratagene, Pathdetect system). We have also shown previously that AP-1 activation by a range of cytokines is blocked by tribbles-3 in this system, thus validating the biological importance of tribbles activity in this assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5(A)</xref>, both truncated trb-2 versions as well as the full-length protein inhibited AP-1 activation. In addition, PCA analysis demonstrated that both MEK1 and MKK7 are able to form complexes with the truncated trb-2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref>). However, we note that the level of PCA signal was reduced when truncated trb-2 were expressed, suggesting that the terminal regions may contribute to the stability of tribbles&#x02013;MKK complexes. Experiments testing this hypothesis are currently underway. The specificity of trb-2/MAPKK interactions, as detected by PCA, was assessed by FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C and D</xref>). Co-expression of an increasing amount of &#x02018;unlabelled&#x02019; trb-2 led to a dose-dependent elimination of the YFP signal both in the trb-2/MKK7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref>) and trb-2&#x02013;MEK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5D</xref>) complexes, as detected by FACS. In addition, neither MKK-Venus nor trb-2-Venus fusion proteins interacted with their zip-Venus counterparts (these were used as positive control constructs in the system), which further supports the specific nature of this interaction.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Trb-2 kinase-like domain is required for inhibiting AP-1 activation and binding to MKKs. (A) The ability of wild-type trb-2 and truncated protein forms, lacking either the N- or the C-terminal protein domain, to inhibit MEKK1-induced AP-1 activation was measured in a luciferase assay system, using HeLa cells as a test system, as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). As a control for inhibition of AP-1 activation, wild-type trb-1 protein expression construct was used. (B) The capacity of trb-2 proteins, lacking the N- or C-terminal protein domains, was assessed by PCA, as above. MEK1 and MKK7 were expressed in fusion with the N-terminal V1 fragment of YFP; full-length and mutant trb-2 was fused to the C-terminal V2 fragment, as previously. (C) (D) FACS was used to show the specificity of interaction between trb-2 and MEK1 and MKK7. Three doses of untagged trb-2 expression plasmid (relative to the amount of trb2-V2) were co-transfected (1/10, 1/1 and 10/1) with the above PCA constructs and the mean fluorescence intensity was calculated in the varying samples. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett&#x02019;s Multiple Comparison Test (with no untagged trb-2 transfected) was performed to analyse the results. **<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="intimmdxn116f05_lw"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Appreciation of the molecular events occurring in response to signalling through pattern recognition receptors within monocytes is essential to understanding innate immunity, as well as conditions when these pathways and processes are subverted in disease pathogenesis. The data presented here illuminate the role of trb-2, a novel, negative regulator of MAPK signalling in the context of LPS stimulation of monocytes. AcLDL, which signals in a manner similar to oxLDL, down-regulates the expression of trb-2. This, in turn, leads to enhanced IL-8 production in LPS-stimulated monocyte cells. Data in other systems have revealed the capacity for tribbles proteins to interact with a range of cell signalling pathways, including members of the MAPK and PI3K network and a number of transcription factors [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>)]. We show here that IL-8 expression is controlled by specific MAPK pathways, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of the ERK and JNK pathways and by siRNA-mediated suppression of MEK1 and MKK4, MKK7 expression, respectively. In line with the proposed inhibitory action of trb-2, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of trb-2 expression leads to a significant increase in JNK and ERK activation. Our experiments investigating physical interaction between proteins have shown that trb-2 can interact with MKK7 or MEK1, activators of ERK and JNK. These data indicate that trb-2 is an important negative regulator of monocyte IL-8 production in response to LPS and controls the augmentation of this response by AcLDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Fig. 6.</label><caption><p>A model for the role of trb-2 in monocyte biology in inflammatory settings.

This is in keeping with the findings of others which support the mechanism of action of tribbles through physical interaction with other signal transduction proteins. This has led to their description as scaffold/regulatory proteins. Our current observations are in strong support of this model. However, molecular details of tribbles/MAPKK interactions and the detailed mode of tribbles action on activation of kinase cascades remain to be determined. It is also noteworthy that trb-2 has been reported to be expressed primarily in the cytoplasm, while trb-1 and -3 are believed to be nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Currently, there are no published data on the nature and relevance of interaction between MAPK pathways and trb-2. We suggest that the basic molecular mechanisms responsible for tribbles action are similar for trb-2 to those we have reported to trb-1 previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). We have carried out preliminary analysis to characterize the domains of trb-2 protein necessary for the observed MAPK inhibitory activity and investigated, whether the domain minimally required for the inhibition of MAPK activation is also sufficient for the formation of MAPKK&#x02013;trb-2 complexes. Our data demonstrate that the trb-2 kinase-like domain is sufficient for both activities. These results are in line with our previous reports on trb-1.</p><p>The experiments in this study provide evidence that tribbles, a novel group of proteins, can act as regulators of innate immune responses in monocytes. Modulation of such key components may be particularly attractive to pharmacotherapy as the predicted outcome of trb-2 up-regulation (or prevention of down-regulation) would be to reduce innate immune responsiveness without its total abolition. Based on this, we believe that further studies exploring the regulation of tribbles expression in inflammatory disease are warranted to determine whether inhibition of tribbles expression occurs in these conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p><grant-sponsor>British Heart Foundation project grants</grant-sponsor> (<grant-num>PG/02/122</grant-num>, <grant-num>PG/05/100</grant-num>); <grant-sponsor>Short Term Visiting Fellowship of European Federation of Immunological Societies</grant-sponsor> to K.E.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><def-list><title>Abbreviations</title><def-item><term>AcLDL</term><def><p>acetylated low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AML</term><def><p>acute myeloid leukaemias</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AP-1</term><def><p>activating protein-1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERK</term><def><p>extracellular signal-regulated kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>JNK</term><def><p>jun kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p>low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAPK</term><def><p>mitogen-activated protein kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>oxLDL</term><def><p>oxidized low-density lipoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCA</term><def><p>protein fragment complementation assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI3K</term><def><p>phosphoinositide 3-kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>trb-1(2)</term><def><p>tribbles-1(2)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YFP</term><def><p>yellow fluorescent protein</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The authors thank Prof. Stephen Michnick for the Venus PCA constructs.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilkin</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Suarez-Huerta</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Robaye</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Characterization of a phosphoprotein whose mRNA is regulated by the mitogenic pathways in dog thyroid cells</article-title><source>Eur.
