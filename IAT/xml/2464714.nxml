These inhibitory events by DLC1 were RhoGAP-dependent, as RhoGAP-deficient mutant of DLC1 (DLC1 K714E) abolished these inhibitory events. In addition, from western study, DLC1 inhibited ROCK-related myosin light chain phosphatase targeting unit 1 (MYPT1) phosphorylation at Threonine 853.

Deregulation of Rho/ROCK pathway may be consequentially related to its aberrant upstream regulatory pathway. We previously demonstrated that DLC1 is a RhoGAP protein and it is therefore logical to speculate that DLC1 suppresses cancer cell metastasis through negatively regulating ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement. However, this hypothesis has never been tested experimentally and the mechanistic basis of how DLC1 suppresses cancer cell metastasis has not been delineated. Hence, it is strategic to examine the possible functional links between DLC1 and ROCK pathway and their implications in HCC.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that DLC1 inhibited ROCK-mediated cytoskeletal events including formation of stress fiber and focal contact network and phosphorylation of MLC2 at cell cortex. Significantly, these inhibitory effects of DLC1 depended on its RhoGAP activity. In addition, we have shown that DLC1 functioned as a negative regulator of ROCK in controlling cell morphology.

We also counted the number of cells that exhibited cell collapse or shrinkage caused by collapse of cytoskeletal network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002779-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Wong1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Lavelin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Kawai1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this study to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in the regulation of HCC cell migration and invasion by DLC1, we have shown that DLC1 suppressed HCC cell migration through regulating the cytoskeleton and actomyosin contraction. Also, we have shown that DLC1 functioned as a negative regulator of ROCK in controlling cell morphology.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>DLC1 negatively regulated ROCK mediated actomyosin contractility</title><p>The contractile motion of cancer cells is generated by consecutive contractions of actomyosin bundles composed of actin and myosin called actomyosin. These actomyosin bundles, visualized as stress fibers, stretch across the cell body and create a tension to generate cell contraction to drive cell movement by connecting with the focal adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Kaverina1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the previous study on the inhibitory effect of DLC1 on stress fibers, herein we further found that the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions network was dependent on DLC1 RhoGAP and ROCK activity in HCC cells. This finding further elucidates that stress fibers and focal adhesions work hand in hand as described by Hall A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Hall2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, and their formation is interdependent and tightly regulated by RhoGAP of DLC1 and ROCK activity. In addition, DLC1 decreased ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 (Thr853) and phosphorylation of MLC2 (Ser19) and would consequently lead to a decrease of total myosin phosphorylation and cause a reduction of stress fiber contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Katoh1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. All these lines of evidence converged to explain that DLC1 controlled one of the pivotal migratory mechanisms, actomyosin contraction, similar to another member of the RhoGAP family, p190-RhoGAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Peacock1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>DLC1 abolished focal adhesion formation and also localized to focal adhesion complex</title><p>An intriguing issue of this finding about the inhibitory effect of RhoGAP on focal adhesion molecules has arisen. DLC1 and several members of the RhoGAP proteins including p122-RhoGAP and RC-GAP72 were found to be localized at the focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Lavelin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Kawai1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, others and we have previously reported that DLC1 also localized to focal adhesions and interacted with members of the tensin family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Qian1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Yam1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Liao1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study, we found that DLC1 suppressed stress fiber-linked focal adhesion formation by its RhoGAP activity. From immunofluorescence study, we observed that, in a portion of DLC1 transfected cells, DLC1 exhibited a focal adhesion localization pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002779.s001">Figure S1A</xref>); whereas in some other DLC1 transfected cells, especially those displaying extensive cell shrinkage, an intensive loss of stress fiber-linked focal adhesions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002779-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). DLC1 localization to focal adhesions and its inhibitory effect on focal adhesions are not mutually exclusive. We speculate that dosage effect might be one of the factors involved. When a cell was transfected with a high dose of DLC1, DLC1 would extinguish all the stress fibers and the stress fiber-linked focal adhesions and result in extensive cell collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002779-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). On the other hand, when a cell was transfected with a lower dose of DLC1, DLC1 would extinguish most of the stress fibers and stress fiber-linked focal adhesions but spare some focal adhesions not linked to stress fibers and result in a milder cell collapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002779.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Another speculation was that similar to RC-GAP72 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Lavelin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, DLC1 might localize to focal adhesion to disintegrate the focal adhesion complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Cytoskeletal collapse induced cell shrinkage and the impact of DLC1 on cytoskeletal collapse</title><p>Focal adhesions and actomyosin stress fibers always work in inter-dependent manner and they together construct a scaffold to support an intact morphology of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Lavelin1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. The disruptions of the abovementioned network caused by DLC1 led to an intensive cell cytoskeletal collapse resulting in cell shrinkage. This finding was similar to Barberis D <italic>et al.</italic>'s study on p190RhoGAP that loss of focal adhesions induced by p190RhoGAP preceded cell shrinkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Barberis1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. We observed that loss of focal adhesions and stress fibers took place an hour after ROCK inhibition by Y27632, but cells did not collapse immediately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002779-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) until prolonged treatment of Y27632 up to 24 hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002779.s002">Figure S2</xref>). From this observation, we conjecture that cell collapse caused by Y27632 treatment was ensued from loss of focal adhesion and stress fiber network. Upon inhibition of ROCK by Y27632, the cytoskeletal networks could not be formed and the cells could no longer endure the loss of cytoskeletal network and eventually undergo cell collapse, which we observed as cell shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002779-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The present study showed that the cytoskeletal collapse induced by DLC1, a RhoGAP which its downregulation is associated with HCC progression, could be partially reversed by active ROCK, further implying that DLC1 negatively regulated ROCK in controlling actomyosin contractility, cell morphology, and cell migration sequentially. Our previous study reported that DLC1 not only suppressed cell migration but also cell invasion which involved extracellular matrix barrier. Sahai E <italic>et al.</italic> reported that cancer cell lines might possess different modes of cell motility and the rounded morphology cancer cell lines were more sensitive to ROCK inhibitor in 3-dimensional matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002779-Sahai1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whether this model is applicable to HCC cells and whether other extracellular proteolytic pathways coorperate with the DLC1/Rho/ROCK/MLC pathway are still unknown and awaited to be addressed.</p><fig id="pone-0002779-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002779.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model of DLC1 induced cytoskeletal collapse.</title><p>(A) Stress fibers were connected to focal adhesions forming a network.
