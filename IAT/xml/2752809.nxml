This effect on cell proliferation was associated with microtubules stabilization and diminution of estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;) and progesterone receptor (PR) transcriptional activities, due to shifts in their subcellular localization and sequestration in the cytoplasm. In addition, COMT over expression or treatment with 2ME reduced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor -1&#x003b1; (HIF-1 &#x003b1;) and the basal level as well as TNF-&#x003b1;-induced aromatase (CYP19) expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>COMT over expression or treatment with 2ME stabilize microtubules, ameliorates E<sub>2</sub>-induced proliferation, inhibits ER&#x003b1; and PR signaling, and reduces HIF-1 &#x003b1; and CYP19 expression in human uterine leiomyoma cells. Thus, microtubules are a candidate target for treatment of uterine leiomyomas. In addition, the naturally occurring microtubule-targeting agent 2ME represents a potential new therapeutic for uterine leiomyomas.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynecological tumors in reproductive age women. It is estimated that the incidence of uterine leiomyomas is over 80&#x00025; in African-American women by age 50, whereas Caucasian women have an incidence of almost 70&#x00025; at a similar age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Hoekstra1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although uterine leiomyomas are benign tumors, they have a tremendous medical and economical impact. Uterine leiomyomas are the leading indication for hysterectomy in the United States <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Farquhar1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Myomectomy and uterine artery embolization are also common treatments; however, hysterectomy may be eventually required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Murray1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Substantial experimental and clinical evidence indicates that steroid hormones (estrogens and progesterone) and their cognate receptors are important etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of leiomyomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Okolo1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, Ishikawa H, et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Ishikawa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> reported that estrogen receptor subtype alpha (ER&#x003b1;) mRNA levels were 1.8 to 2.6-fold higher in uterine leiomyomas compared with adjacent myometrium. Similarly, progesterone receptors A and B (PRA &#x00026; PRB) are expressed at significantly higher levels in uterine leiomyomas compared to normal myometrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Englund1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Nisolle1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The transcriptional activities of estrogen and progesterone receptors are inherently regulated by microtubules (MT) dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Manavathi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. MT are highly dynamic polymers comprised of &#x003b1;/&#x003b2;-tubulin heterodimers and their biological functions are largely regulated by their polymerization/depolymerization dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Jordan1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Mitchison1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

Indeed, it has been reported that destabilization of MT activates ER&#x003b1; transcriptional activity, whereas stabilization of MT represses ER&#x003b1; transactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Manavathi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME) is an endogenous 17 &#x003b2;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) metabolite with antimitotic, antiangiogenic, and proapoptotic effects.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that 2ME or COMT gene over expression, by the virtue of 2ME formation, inhibit the proliferation of human leiomyoma cells by affecting MT dynamic which in turn regulate the nuclear receptors signaling pathways.

The current study was undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. We have further examined whether manipulation of COMT expression, by the virtue of 2ME formation, can affect leiomyoma cells. Our data show that 2ME (500 nM) halts E<sub>2</sub>-induced huLM proliferation, promotes microtubules polymerization, attenuates nuclear receptors signaling, antagonizes TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced CYP19 expression, and decreases HIF-1&#x003b1; protein levels. Interestingly, our results suggest that COMT overexpression produces effects similar to 2ME treatment. Although COMT is constitutively expressed in huLM cells, this expression level and the resultant concentration of 2ME is lower than the minimum concentration that can affect proliferation of these cells.

It has been reported that microtubules play a role in nuclear transport of NF-&#x003ba;B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Mikenberg1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent transcription activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Shrum1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely, therefore, that COMT/2ME-induced microtubule stabilization inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B in huLM and therefore, CYP19 expression.</p><p>Another critical factor for the uterine leiomyomas growth is the transcription factor HIF-1&#x003b1; which regulates the expression of growth factors and profibrotic mediators, such as platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblasts growth factor-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and connective tissue growth factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Moon1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The products of these genes are known to influence cell proliferation and extracellular matrix turnover which are critical processes in leiomyoma growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Ding1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Yu1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Sourla1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Hwu1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data demonstrated that huLM cells express a constitutive level of HIF-1&#x003b1;, which is significantly increased by CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced hypoxia. Intriguingly, COMT/2ME inhibited both basal and hypoxia-induced HIF-1&#x003b1; expression in huLM. The effect of COMT/2ME on HIF-1 &#x003b1; is probably a consequence of microtubule stabilization. Indeed, it has been reported that disruption of microtubule dynamics, both by microtubule-stabilizing and microtubule-destabilizing agents, inhibits HIF-1 &#x003b1; expression and activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007356-Escuin1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, COMT/2ME exerts several therapeutic effects on huLM. It inhibits steroid nuclear receptor signaling, reduces aromatase gene expression, and down-regulates HIF-1 &#x003b1; expression. These pleiotropic therapeutic effects of COMT/2ME on huLM suggest that microtubule targeting agents could represent a potential new therapeutic for uterine leiomyomas. Considering the fact that it is an orally-active natural metabolite, with excellent safety profile in human, 2ME represents a potential medicinal treatment for uterine leiomyomas. Pre-clinical studies to support its use in uterine leiomyomas can be initiated</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0007356-Hoekstra1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation
