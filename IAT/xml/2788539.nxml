Activation of TASK-1 channels produces an outwardly rectifying current at normal physiological condition. The currents do not show time- and voltage-dependent activation, inactivation or deactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. With a pK<sub>a </sub>of 7.3, TASK-1 channels could be open throughout an AP of cardiac cells and therefore contribute to repolarization of APs as well as to the RMP. In addition to its pH sensitivity, TASK-1 channel is also sensitive to oxygen and local anesthetics and is tightly regulated through protein kinases A, C, G and phospholipase C signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, the functional role of TASK-1 channel will depend to a great extent on where it is expressed.</p><p>TASK-1 channel is highly expressed in heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. By means of real time PCR, Liu et al shows that TASK-1 is one of the predominant K2P channels and is expressed more in the atria than in the ventricles of both embryonic and adult rat heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In adult mouse heart, TASK-1 is expressed in the atria but not in the ventricles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We have characterized the cardiac expression of TASK-1 channel in developing chick and mouse hearts with immunofluorescent staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The expression pattern of TASK-1 channel in chick embryonic heart was similar to that in the developing mouse heart, where TASK-1 channels were expressed ubiquitously in the tubular heart but later in development it was restricted to ventricular conduction system.</p><p>We were intrigued by the expression of TASK-1 channels throughout the heart tube in early developmental stages. In the early tubular heart, all myocytes including ventricular myocytes exhibit spontaneous electrical activities similar to adult sinoatrial nodal cells. The lack of inward rectification K<sup>+ </sup>currents (I<sub>K1 </sub>or Kir channels) likely contributes to their automaticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, a small background K<sup>+ </sup>conductance is necessary otherwise the myocytes would be too depolarized to beat spontaneously. Our hypothesis is that TASK-1 channels could be one of the contributors to this small background K<sup>+ </sup>conductance. Although the functional role of TASK-1 channel in developing heart is still unknown it seems likely to be involved in setting RMP and possibly influencing the shape of action potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we further studied the distribution of TASK-1 and its electrophysiology during chicken heart development. Consistent with our previous studies, TASK-1 was highly expressed in the tubular heart early in development. In later development, expression of TASK-1 was retained in the atria but was down-regulated in the ventricle. Likewise, patch clamp studies showed that acid sensitive background K<sup>+ </sup>currents were present in S14 tubular heart and in ED11 atria, but little in ED5 and ED11 ventricle. Conversely, there was little or no I<sub>K1 </sub>in ED11 atrial myocytes while I<sub>K1 </sub>was substantial in ED11 ventricular myocytes. These results demonstrate that TASK-1 channels contribute to background membrane K<sup>+ </sup>conductance where inwardly rectifying K<sup>+ </sup>currents (I<sub>K1</sub>) are not present in the developing heart.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR of TASK-1 and TASK-3</title><p>Whole S11 chick embryos (40 hour incubation at 37&#x000b0;C), heart tubes from S14 (50 hours) and S18 (3 day incubation), ED5 and ED11 hearts were dissected and collected in DEPC-treated PBS solution. The ventricles and atria of ED5 and ED11 embryos were separated under a microscope. The dissected tissues were immediately homogenized in the presence of &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol (&#x003b2;-ME, Sigma). The total RNAs were prepared by using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

Briefly, the atria and ventricles of ED5 and ED11 hearts were separated before the enzymatic digestion. The atria and ventricles of ED5 and ED11 hearts were then incubated for 10 minutes in Mg<sup>2+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+ </sup>free Tyrode solution containing 0.1 mg/ml Trypsin, 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Then, three digestion steps were subsequently carried out at 37&#x000b0;C. The enzyme digestion times were empirically adjusted to achieve maximum viability for each of the developmental stages. The dissociated myocytes were collected by centrifuging and re-suspended in Modified M-199 medium (Gibco Corp.). For the preparation of S14 myocytes, whole S14 tubular hearts were used for dissociation. The myocytes were incubated overnight in a plastic petri dish in which the myocytes did not attach. The myocytes were used within 24 hours after dissociation.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Embryonic myocytes were transferred to a Warner perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments) and were continuously perfused with Tyrode solution (S-1) at a flow rate of ~2 ml/min. For whole-cell patch clamp recordings of TASK currents, dissociated myocytes were initially bathed with Tyrode solution (S-1, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). After the formation of whole cell configuration, bath solution was then switched to experimental solution either S-2 or S-3 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Pipettes were pulled from 1.5 mm borosilicate glass using a P-97 Glass Microelectrode Puller (Sutter Corp.). Patch pipette usually had a resistance of 4-8 M&#x003a9; when filled with pipette solution P-1 or P-2 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The liquid junction potential was cancelled before pipette contacted the cells. When most of external chloride was replaced by aspartate, an agar bridge (3 M KCl) was used to reduce junction potential. The membrane and access resistances were monitored during experiments by means of membrane test in Axon Clampex 8.0 software. Only those cells that had a seal resistance larger than 1 G&#x003a9; were used for the final analysis. Whole-cell currents were sampled at 5 kHz and recorded with an AXOPATCH 200B voltage-clamp amplifier (Axon instrument). The command voltage steps were applied with pCLAMP 8.0 and a DIGIDATA 1322A interface (Axon Instrument). Data were stored on the hard disk for off-line analysis.

TASK currents inhibited by lowering pH from pH 8.4 to 7.4 are only contributed by TASK-1 channels while TASK-3 channels are still active in this pH range.

Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref> shows the I-V relationship of TASK currents at potentials between 0 and +50 mV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In this potential range, TASK currents activated by pH 8.0 were much smaller than those at negative potentials. However, TASK currents were inhibited by either lowering pH to 6.4 or 3 &#x003bc;M anandamide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), indicating that in this potential range TASK currents were mostly due to TASK-1 channels. At +50 mV, the mean currents at pH 8.0, pH6.4 and in the presence of 3 &#x003bc;M anandamide were 7.87 &#x000b1; 1.67, 6.37 &#x000b1; 1.60 and 6.67 &#x000b1; 1.52 pA/pF, respectively. This result is well consistent with pH sensitivity studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) showing that TASK currents between pH7.4 and pH6.4 are mostly due to the TASK-1 channel. Therefore, the currents activated by pH 8.0 and inhibited by pH 6.4 and anandamide are consistent with TASK-1 currents in chick embryonic heart.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of anandamide, pH and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>on TASK-like currents of ED11 atrial myocytes in Cl<sup>- </sup>substituted solutions</bold>.

This qualitative assessment was verified by the application of 100 &#x003bc;M Ba<sup>2+</sup>, which blocked a small amount of inward current in the atrium and a much larger amount in the ventricle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

TASK-1 is initially expressed throughout the myocardium in the early heart tube. Expression of TASK-1 remained in the atria, but was down-regulated later in the ventricles. TASK-3 is consistently present at all chick heart developmental ages. Consistent with expression studies, TASK-1 currents are present in tubular heart, but the current densities are the highest later in the developing atria. In contrast, I<sub>K1 </sub>has 4-5 times lesser current density in ED11 atrial myocytes than in ED11 ventricular myocytes that have only small TASK-1 currents. Our electrophysiological and TASK-1 mRNA expression data clearly demonstrate the presence of TASK-1 channels in native embryonic cardiac myocytes and its contribution to background K<sup>+ </sup>conductance. The developmental regulation of TASK-1 expression suggests that TASK-1 is important both in heart development and in regulating membrane potentials.</p><sec><title>Developmental expression and regulation of TASK-1 channel in chick embryonic heart</title><p>The distribution of TASK-1 during heart development may imply its functional role. Compared to TASK-3, TASK-1 is ubiquitously expressed earlier in heart development. TASK-1 expression is down-regulated later in development in ventricle but is maintained in later developmental stages in atria. On the other hand, TASK-3 channels are more uniformly expressed in all chick heart developmental stages.</p><p>The distinguishing characteristics of TASK channels (mainly TASK-1 and TASK-3) are their sensitivity to external pH. Here we showed an acid-sensitive background K<sup>+ </sup>current in the developing chicken heart having similar characteristics that are consistent with TASK-1 channels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, in the symmetrical K<sup>+ </sup>and chloride-free solutions, I-V relations of TASK currents show strong inward rectification, closely resembling the I-V relationships of TASK-1 single channel conductance and TASK-1/TASK-3 channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. TASK currents also become bigger at negative potentials. These data suggest the possibility that TASK-1 current is masked by a Cl<sup>- </sup>current when measured in symmetrical KCl solutions.</p><p>The difference in pH sensitivity of TASK-1 and TASK-3 (pKa of 7.3 and 6.7 respectively) has been successfully used to distinguish these channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, anandamide and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>have been used as relatively selective inhibitors of cloned TASK-1 and TASK-3 currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Although both anandamide and zinc are endogenous ion channel modulators and at higher concentrations they could inhibit other K2P channels, the concentrations used here are to selectively inhibit TASK-1 or TASK-3 channels. Therefore, TASK currents in chick embryonic heart that show the sensitivity to both anadamide and external protons are mostly due to TASK-1 channels.</p><p>Anandamide-sensitive TASK-1 currents comprise only about two-thirds of the acid-sensitive background K<sup>+ </sup>currents in the ED11 atrium. One possibility is because the inhibition of TASK-1 by anandamide is less effective at negative potentials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Still, we could not preemptively exclude the contribution of other acid sensitive K2P channels. Among the five members of TASK family, TASK-5 is a non-functional channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and TASK-4 actually belongs to the TALK subfamily and is activated at alkaline pH (&#x0003e;pH 8.0). TASK-2 is strongly expressed in epithelial tissues, particular in the kidney to regulate cell volume but, is only weakly expressed in the adult heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, the contribution from other acid sensitive K2P channels should be relatively small.</p><p>It is surprising that although TASK-3 mRNA was present at a relatively higher level and was expressed equally at all developmental stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) its contribution to TASK currents is quite small under our experimental conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). 100 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2+ </sup>does not induce a significant inhibition of TASK currents in chick ED11 atrial myocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). One possible explanation is that TASK-3 might form functional heterodimers with TASK-1 in native embryonic cardiac myocytes because heterologous TASK-1/TASK-3 channel has an intermediate pH sensitivity and low sensitivity to ruthenium red and Zn<sup>2+ </sup>(16-17). In fact, in TASK-1 knockout mice, TASK currents, mostly contributed by homodimers of TASK-3 channels, are greatly inhibited by 100 &#x003bc;M Zn<sup>2+ </sup>in cerebellar granule neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Functional TASK-1/TASK-3 heterodimers have been reported in cerebellar granule cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Possible functional role of TASK-1 in embryonic cardiac excitability</title><p>In the early tubular heart, all myocytes exhibit spontaneous electrical activity similar to adult sinoatrial node cells and have a relatively depolarized maximum diastolic potential. The spontaneous activity or automaticity of the early tubular heart is a consequence of the less negative maximum diastolic potential that is due to the lack of I<sub>K1</sub>, higher P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>K </sub>permeability, and higher membrane resistance of embryonic myocytes which are similar to SA nodal cells in adult hearts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. With a higher membrane resistance, a small current such as TASK-1 current could play a significant role in modulating embryonic cardiac action potentials.</p><p>In chick heart development, a significant hyperpolarizing change in RMP in ventricular myocytes occurs between ED5 and ED7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the developing chick atria, RMP does not change significantly between ED9 and ED19, and atria have a more depolarized RMP (-63 mV) compared to the ventricle (-80 mV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Data shown here indicates that TASK-1 expression is down-regulated during the period when the RMP becomes more hyperpolarized and I<sub>K1 </sub>is evidently present in developing chick ventricle. This indicates that I<sub>K1 </sub>is a dominant contributor to RMP in ventricle after about ED5. In embryonic atria where there is a lack of I<sub>K1</sub>, temperature-sensitive TREK channels have been shown to play a very important role in setting RMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, TASK-1 channels are unlikely to play a dominant role in setting RMP although they are maintained in ED11 atrial myocytes. However, unlike TREK channels, TASK-1 channels do not have strong temperature sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. During avian heart development, the temperature environment may vary significantly. Therefore when temperature dependent inactivation of TREK channels occurs and there is a lack of the normally dominant background K<sup>+ </sup>current, I<sub>K1</sub>, TASK-1 channels remain active and could play a role in maintaining the stability of membrane potentials.</p><p>In general, TASK-1 may contribute to setting the maximum diastolic potential, to the repolarization of action potentials, and to shortening the duration of action potential as has been shown for TASK-1 activity in adult rat and mouse ventricular myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we were able to demonstrate the functional expression of TASK-1 in the early tubular heart and in the embryonic atrial myocytes. The expression of TASK-1 is developmentally regulated in chick embryonic heart. Functional expression of TASK-1 is likely to be a contributor to background membrane conductance in cardiac myocytes from early tubular heart to embryonic atrial myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>TASK: TWIK-related Acid Sensitive Potassium Channels; RMP: resting membrane potential; AP: Action Potential; ED: Embryonic Day; K2P: Two-pore Domain Potassium Channels; NTB: Nitro-Blue Tetrazolium Chloride; BCIP: 5-Bromo-4-Chloro-3'-Indolyphosphate p-Toluidine Salt; TEA: Tetraethylammonium; 4-AP: 4-Aminopyridine; EGTA: Ethylene Glycol-bis [&#x003b2;-aminoethyl ether] N,N,N'N'-tetraacetric acid; DMSO: dimethylsulfoxide.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HZ designed, performed experiments and prepared a draft of the manuscript.
