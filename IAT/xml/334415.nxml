The lambda clone containing murine 5' HS-2 extends approximately 12 kb upstream from this site; here, we report the sequence of this entire upstream region. The murine homologue of 5' HS-3 is located approximately 16.0 kb upstream from the mouse epsilon y-globin gene, but no region homologous to human 5' HS-4 was present in our clone. Using a reporter system consisting of a human gamma-globin promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (gamma-neo), we tested murine LCR fragments extending from -21 to -9 kb (with respect to the epsilon y-globin gene cap site) for activity in classical enhancer and integration site assays in K562 and MEL cells. 5' HS-2 behaved as a powerful enhancer and increased the number of productive integration events (as measured by a colony assay) in both K562 and MEL cells. 5' HS-3 had no activity in K562 cells or in transiently transfected MEL cells, but was nearly as active as 5' HS-2 in the MEL cell colony assay. Two additional tests confirmed the identification of murine 5' HS-3: first, a DNA fragment containing 5' HS-3 confers copy number-dependent, integration-site independent inducibility on a linked beta-globin gene in the MEL cell environment. Secondly, a strong DNAseI hypersensitive site maps to the location of the 5' HS-3 functional core in chromatin derived from MEL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that we have identified the murine homologue of human 5' HS-3, and that this site is functional when integrated into the chromatin of MEL cells but not K562 cells. 5' HS-3 may therefore contain information that contributes to the development-specific expression of the beta-like globin genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0256-a" xlink:role="5776"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0256-b" xlink:role="5776"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0257-a" xlink:role="5777"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0251.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5771"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0252.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5772"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0253.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5773"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0254.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5774"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0255.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5775"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0256.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5776"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0257.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5777"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00232-0258.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5778"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
